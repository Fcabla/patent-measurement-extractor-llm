Aspects of the invention include nitrogen oxide storage materials, catalytic traps for the abatement of nitrogen oxide, methods for manufacturing both the nitrogen oxide storage materials and the catalytic traps for the abatement of nitrogen oxides, and methods of abating nitrogen oxide in an exhaust gas Stream. According to one embodiment, the nitrogen oxide storage materials comprise ceria particles having alkaline earth oxides, for example, baria, Supported on the particles, the ceria having a crystallite size of between about 10 and 20 nm and the alkaline earth oxides having a crystallite size of between about 20 and 40 nm. Other suitable alkaline earth oxides include oxides of Mg, Sr. and Ca. In certain embodi ments, the composite particles have a BET surface area of between about 30 and 80 m/g. In another embodiment, a nitrogen oxide storage catalyst is provided comprising a coat ing on a Substrate, the coating comprising a nitrogen oxide storage material comprising spray-dried ceria particles hav ing baria Supported on the particles. In certain embodiments, the coating of the nitrogen oxide storage catalyst further comprises at least one member of platinum group metals selected from the group consisting of platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium and mixtures thereof supported on refractory oxide particles. The refractory oxide particles may be selected from the group consisting of alumi num oxide, mixed aluminum oxide and Zirconium oxide, mixed aluminum oxide and lanthanum oxide, mixed alumi num oxide and cerium oxide, mixed aluminum oxide and magnesium oxide, and alumina oxide mixed with one or more of Zirconia and lanthana. Another embodiment relates to a catalytic trap disposed in an exhaust passage of an internal combustion engine which operates periodically between lean and stoichiometric or rich conditions, for abatement of NOX in an exhaust gas stream which is generated by the engine. The catalytic trap com prises a catalytic trap material including a precious metal catalytic component effective for oxidizing NO to NO under lean conditions and promoting the reduction of released NOx to nitrogen under Stoichiometric or rich conditions Supported on a refractory metal oxide, and a NOX storage material effective for adsorbing the NOx under lean conditions and desorbing the NOx under stoichiometric or rich conditions, the NOX storage material comprising particles of ceria having alkaline earth carbonate Supported on the ceria particles, hav ing a crystallite size of between about 10 and 20 nm and the alkaline earth oxide having a crystallite size of between about 20 and 40 nm, and the catalytic trap material being disposed on a refractory carrier member. Still another embodiment relates to a method of making a nitrogen oxide storage mate rial comprising mixing a solution of barium with ceria par ticles, spray drying the particles, heating the spray-dried par ticles, mixing the composite particles with a precious metal Supported catalyst and coating the slurry mixture of particles on a Substrate.

## Results analysis
As can be seen in the model results, 11 measurements have been extracted. 
Of the 11 measurements, we can see that 4 of them are wrong. These four measurements share two problems: 
- The value parameter does not contain a valid element (there is not even a number) 
- The unit parameter is empty.

This kind of errors are quite common. So, instead of trying to improve the prompt by more precise instructions or by editing and selecting other examples, I have decided that it is better to **validate the result**. This idea treats the output of the model as if it were the input of a user in a system or web development.
The implemented validation is very simple, it consists of checking that the value contains at least one number and that the unit is not 'N/A', 'unitless', '' or similar.

Another possible solution would be to do fine tuning on the model. For this we would need a representative amount of annotated data. This solution requires more effort but is better in the long run as it reduces the cost of api calls (no need to include examples and instructions), produces more robust results and ensures that the model learns the desired output format.

The other 7 results seems to be correct.
