# Results
In this directory the different results generated by the measurement extraction pipeline are stored. All the results are stored in JSON format. These results files and directories are listed below together with a short description

- **results_extracted_patents.json**: File containing, for each patent, the texts chunks that have been processed along with the extracted raw and validated measurements. This file is the result of the last execution of the pipeline.

- **results_extracted_patents_valid.json**: File containing, for each patent, the texts chunks that have been processed along with just the extracted validated measurements. This file is the result of the last execution of the pipeline.

- **stored_results**: Directory containing results from previous executions that are worth to store. Mainly, the files insed this directory are the ones used to evaluate the solution and understand the common errors.

- **stored_results/results_extracted_patents_1st.json**: Similar to **results_extracted_patents.json**. Used to evaluate the solution and understand its performance

- **stored_results/results_extracted_patents_valid_1st.json**: Similar to **results_extracted_patents_valid.json**. Used to evaluate the solution and understand its performance
