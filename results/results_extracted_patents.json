Conventional refrigeration systems can include at least a compressor, a heat rejection exchanger (i.e., a condenser), a liquid refrigerant receiver, an expansion device, and a heat absorption exchanger (i.e., an evaporator). Such systems can be used to maintain operating temperature set points for a wide variety of cooled heat sources (loads, processes, equipment, systems) thermally interacting with the evaporator. Closed-circuit refrigeration systems may pump significant amounts of absorbed thermal energy from heat sources into the surrounding environment. Condensers and compressors can be heavy and can consume relatively large amounts of power. In general, the larger the amount of absorbed thermal energy that the system is designed to handle, the heavier the refrigeration system and the larger the amount of power consumed during operation, even when cooling of a heat source occurs over relatively short time periods.

As a result, the temperature of the high heat flux load can be stabilized to within a relatively narrow range of temperatures. Such temperature stabilization can be particularly important for heat-sensitive high flux loads such as electronic components and devices, which can be easily damaged via excess heating.

A known image forming apparatus includes an image forming unit configured to form an image on one side of a sheet and to form an image on the other side of the sheet transported, along a retransport path, back to the image forming unit.

The present invention relates to bone fixation devices, and, more particularly, to sternal closure strap devices. Sternal fixation or closure devices are used to fix together portions of a sternum in a reapproximation medical procedure. Various surgical procedures require that the sternum is cut in half and separated before the desired surgical procedure(s) is conducted in the thoracic cavity. In so doing, the surgeon will conduct a partial or median sternotomy wherein a longitudinal incision is made in the sternum which then allows the portions, e.g. halves, of the sternum to be separated. After the surgical procedure(s) has been conducted, the sternum must be reapproximated using one or more sternal fixation devices to hold and secure the portions of the sternum together. Generally, each sternal fixation device will engage or otherwise wrap around the sternal portions in order to hold and secure the sternal portions together. A typical sternal fixation device comprises a stainless-steel wire. In operation, the wire is wrapped around the sternal portions or weaved within",

In operation, the wire is wrapped around the sternal portions or weaved within through-holes in each sternal portion to form a loop that engages with both of the sternal portions. Thereafter, a separate tool, such as a tensioner, is required to twist the ends of the wire around one another to tighten the loop and secure the sternal portions together. Once the looped wired is sufficiently tight, another tool, such as a wire cutter, is required to cut the excess wire in order to reduce the overall profile of the sternal fixation device. Generally, it is a cumbersome process to hold the tensioner and operate the wire cutters at the same time. Furthermore, without designated tension indicators, the user of the various tools may under or over tighten the wire, which may damage the sternum and/or surrounding tissue. As can be appreciated, any damage to the sternum and/or surrounding tissue may cause a plethora of issues, including a partial or complete separation of the sternal portions.

Some embodiments include a pharmaceutical composition, dosage form, or medicament comprising a therapeutically effective amount of dextromethorphan, a therapeutically effective amount of an antidepressant, such as bupropion, hydroxybupropion, erythrohydroxybupropion, threohydroxybupropion, or a metabolite or prodrug of any of these compounds, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Some embodiments include a method of reducing a risk of seizure associated with use of bupropion to treat depression, comprising orally administering a dextromethorphan-bupropion combination twice a day, wherein the method is: 1) at least as effective in treating depression, and 2) reduces the risk of seizure to the human being, as compared to orally administering 150 mg of the bupropion alone twice a day to the human being for the same number of days. Some embodiments include a method of improving the therapeutic effect of bupropion in treating depression, comprising orally co-administering a dextromethorphan with a bupropion, twice a day, to a human being suffering from depression, wherein the method is more effective than treating the depression of that human being by orally administering 150 mg of the bupropion alone twice a day to the human being for five weeks.

An autonomous traveling technology and a driving assistance technology in which a moving object, such as a robot and a car, collects information around the moving object, estimates a current position and a traveling state of the moving object, and controls traveling of the moving object have been developed. Various sensors are used to detect the information around the moving object. In general, sensors for measuring surrounding information include imaging devices such as a camera, laser sensors, and millimeter wave radars. A global positioning system (GPS) or an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used as a sensor for measuring a position of a moving object. In autonomous traveling control, a control device mounted on a moving object estimates a position of the moving object itself (self-position) by integrating the speed or angular velocity of the moving object calculated by the IMU or using GPS positioning. In addition, when there are neither map information nor any landmark and even GPS is not available, a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method is used to create a map of a traveling environment while estimating a relative position of an object",

Since an error of the relative position estimated by SLAM is accumulated, position correction is essential. For the position correction, for example, a control device collects surrounding information with a laser sensor, a camera, or the like, and detects a position or a shape of a three-dimensional object that serves as a reference for position estimation. Then, a current position of the moving object is corrected by comparing the detected position of the three-dimensional object with map information (map matching). Therefore, if an error of the detected position of the three-dimensional object is large, it is difficult to correct the position of the moving object. In addition, when a position error is already large before the correction, it is difficult to correct the current position even if the map matching is performed. Here, for example, in NPL 1, a plurality of virtual current positions are created and virtual intensity image and parallax image are created using each of the virtual positions, map information, internal and external parameters",

Hemodialysis is the treatment of choice for >90% of CKD patients in the US. Without hemodialysis or some other form of renal replacement therapy, most patients with CKD would die. A typical CKD patient undergoing hemodialysis treatment must have their vascular system connected to a hemodialysis machine two to three times per week. For hemodialysis, there are three common vascular access site options. The preferred access site option is an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), which is a direct, surgically created connection between an artery and a vein, preferably in the wrist, or alternatively, in the forearm or upper arm. Another access site option is an arteriovenous graft (AVG), which is a surgically created connection between an artery and vein using an interposed synthetic conduit, preferably in the forearm, or alternatively, in the upper arm, chest, groin, or leg.

The final major access site option is a catheter inserted into a large vein in the neck, chest, leg, or other anatomic location. Patients with an AVF have less morbidity, less mortality, and a lower cost of care compared with patients with an AVG or a catheter; therefore, AVF is the preferred form of vascular access for hemodialysis. Patients with an AVG or catheter have substantially higher rates of infection and death than patients having an AVF, with catheter patients having the worst outcomes. In addition, patients having an AVG or catheter have a higher average cost of care, with catheter patients having the highest costs. If a patient is eligible for an AVF, the wrist or forearm is generally preferred over an AVF in the upper arm due to higher rates of hand ischemia and the generally shorter and deeper vein segments of the upper arm. One generally accepted principle that is followed when creating AVF and AVG vascular access sites is to start as far distal as possible and to preserve the more proximal veins for vascular access site creation later. This means starting at the wrist for AVF patients and in the forearm for AVG patients. However, the smaller",

This means starting at the wrist for AVF patients and in the forearm for AVG patients. However, the smaller diameter of more distal veins often reduces the success of vascular access surgery in these locations. Unfortunately, about 85 percent of patients are ineligible for an AVF in the wrist, mostly due to vein and artery diameters that are too small. Furthermore, about 50-60 percent of all AVFs created are not useable without additional surgical and interventional procedures due to an occurrence commonly referred to as “maturation failure,” which is correlated with small vein and artery diameter. The availability of veins and arteries with larger diameters is correlated with higher AVF eligibility, lower rates of maturation failure, faster AVF maturation, and prolonged primary and secondary patency rates. Currently, there are few options for permanently or persistently increasing the diameter of a vein or artery. All current methods use mechanical methods of dilation, such as balloon angioplasty, that can lead to vein or artery injury.

Approximately 7 million people in the US suffer from chronic venous insufficiency and hypertension, which can progress to venous ulceration. Lower extremity ulcer is the most common form of chronic wound, with an estimated prevalence of 1% of the US population. About 2.5 million people in the US have a lower extremity ulceration and about 600,000 people seek treatment for a venous ulceration of the lower extremity each year in the US. The incidence of venous ulceration is expected to rise as the population ages. In a survey of patients with venous ulcers, 81% of patients reported an adverse effect on mobility, 56% reported spending up to 8 hours per week on ulcer care, 68% reported a negative emotional impact, including fear, social isolation, anger, depression, and negative self-image.

In a study of 78 venous ulcer patients at the Cleveland Clinic, median ulcer size was 2.8 cm2 (mean=9.4 cm2) and 5% had bilateral ulcers. The median time to ulcer healing was 77 days (mean=108 days) and the mean cost of treatment was $2,400 per month. The mean total cost of treatment to heal an ulcer was $9,685 per patient. For patients requiring more than a year to heal, the average total cost per patient was $18,534. In most cases, venous hypertension and ulceration results from valvular incompetence secondary to deep vein thrombosis or an unknown cause. In a substantial minority of cases, venous hypertension and ulceration results from femoral or pelvic venous obstruction secondary to deep vein thrombosis, vein injury, or extrinsic vein compression.

Leakage of fibrinogen into surrounding tissues binds or “traps” growth factors and cytokines, and renders them unavailable for maintenance and repair of tissue integrity. Lower extremity venous hypertension presents clinically as leg redness and discoloration, swelling, pain, edema, pruritus, scaling, discharge, and lipodermatosclerosis. Ulcers generally develop on the medial aspect of the leg, possess irregular borders, and can be associated with severe pain. Venous ulcers are often complicated by superimposed bacterial infection. The arterial circulation is usually adequate. Current treatments for lower extremity venous hypertension and ulcer are often inadequate. Patients are mostly offered palliative treatments, with the goal of healing ulcers and preventing recurrence, including aggressive wound care, compression therapy to decrease lower extremity venous pressure and increase venous return, lower extremity vein stripping or",

Various studies have shown that the configuration of the outflow conduit and outflow conduit tip directly affects the flow characteristics of the fluid leaving the outflow conduit of a blood pump system. When conduits are used to pump blood out of and back into a patient, there is the risk of thrombogenesis caused by regions of low and high wall shear stress (WSS) in the flow, along with the associated risk of thromboembolic events. For example, it is well understood that regions of low WSS may cause platelet aggregation, while regions of high WSS may cause platelet activation. Regions of very high WSS may also present the risk of hemolysis. For example, a region of WSS greater than 150 Pa is likely to lead to hemolysis.

By either method, the system increases the flow of blood in a vessel, which ultimately leads to a persistent increase in vessel diameter.

This means that the receiving unit is designed to detect the reception angle at which the reflected part of the light beam from the surrounding region is incident on the receiving unit. The reception angle is in this case in particular an angle between a reception direction, from which the reflected part of the light beam is incident on the receiving unit, and the predetermined direction. In this case, a vertical and/or a horizontal component of the",

Therefore, for every measurement, both the emission angle, at which the light beam was emitted into the surrounding region, and also the reception angle, at which the reflected part of this light beam was received from the surrounding region, are known. For every emission angle, the reception angle corresponding to this emission angle can therefore be determined. The receiving unit is designed in this case as angle-resolving by means of the at least two receiving elements. The receiving elements can be designed, for example, as light-sensitive sensor elements, wherein one reception angle is associated with each receiving element. The at least two receiving elements can be arranged in at least one line to detect the horizontal component of the reception angle and/or in at least one column to detect the vertical component of the reception angle.

This means that the reflected light beam is incident essentially on one of the receiving elements of the receiving unit. The associated reception angle can then be determined on the basis of this presently detecting receiving element. The design of the receiving unit as an angle-resolving receiving unit is based on the finding that the distance of the object can only be correctly detected if the emitted light beam is reflected back directly to the receiving unit again. The distance can thus only be detected correctly on the basis of a light beam having a direct signal path. By means of the angle-resolving receiving unit, all the reflected parts of light beams are thus advantageously able to be identified which do not return back to the receiving unit on a direct signal path. This can occur, for example, if the light beam is not reflected directly on the object, but rather is scattered and is deflected onto another object and is reflected on this other object.

The detection device is thus designed particularly reliably. In addition, it is provided that the receiving unit is designed to detect a deviation between the emission angle of the light beam and the reception angle of the reflected part of the light beam corresponding to the emission angle. During each measurement which comprises the emission of the light beam and the reception of the reflected part of the light beam, the emission angle of the light beam and the reception angle corresponding to the emission angle are detected.

The receiving unit is designed in particular to evaluate as invalid a measurement having the emission of the light beam along a specific emission angle and the reception of the reflected part of the light beam emitted at this emission angle if the deviation exceeds a predetermined threshold value for the deviation. Thus, if the emission direction and the receiving unit do not correspond and the angle between the emission direction and the receiving unit is outside a predetermined angle range, the measurement is evaluated as invalid and the distance determined in this measurement on the basis of the runtime is discarded.

It can also be provided that the receiving unit is designed in dependence on the deviation to determine a probability for a plausibility of the measurement, to activate the emitting unit to emit the laser beam again at the emission angle corresponding to this measurement if the probability falls below a predetermined limiting value, and to determine the deviation between the emission angle and the reception angle for the renewed measurement. Plausibility of the detected distance is thus evaluated in dependence on the value or a dimension of the deviation.

Prosthetic heart valves may be formed from biological materials such as harvested bovine valves or pericardium tissue. Such valves are typically fitted within a stent, which may be inserted into the heart at the annulus of the compromised native valve to replace the native valve. Prosthetic heart valves that are collapsible to a relatively small circumferential size can be delivered into a patient less invasively than valves that are not collapsible. For example, a collapsible valve may be delivered into a patient via a tube-like delivery apparatus such as a catheter, a trocar, a laparoscopic instrument, or the like. To perform such insertion procedure, it is often necessary to compress the stent to a reduced diameter for loading into the delivery device. In the case of prosthetic valves formed from biological materials, the stented valve is preferably preserved in the open condition for storage.

Fluorosurfactants are an important constituent in industrial process chemicals. Owing to their persistence and toxicity, these materials are problematic for users and the environment. Fluorine-containing surfactants can be employed in a very wide variety of applications and contribute, for example, to improved wetting of surfaces. Thus, they are used, for example, as interface promoter or emulsifier or viscosity reducer in paints, coatings or adhesives. Classical fluorosurfactants are built up from long-chain, perfluorinated alkyl chains (C6-C8) and are regarded as potentially bioaccumulative and toxic. In general, however, fluorosurfactants contain perfluoroalkyl substituents, which are broken down in the environment by biological and other oxidation processes to give perfluoroalkanecarboxylic acids and -sulfonic acids. These are regarded as persistent and are in some cases suspected of causing health damage (G. L. Kennedy, Jr., J. L. Butenhoff, G. W. Olsen, J. C. O'Connor, A. M. Seacat, R. G. Perkins, L. B.

Shorter-chain fluorine building blocks are more favourable with respect to their ecotoxicological profiles, but often exhibit worse properties in their areas of application. WO 2006/072401 and WO 2010/003567 describe surface-active compounds containing trifluoromethoxy groups.

X-ray imaging of the human breast to detect malignancies has been clinically available since about 1970. As might very well be expected, since then, over the period of almost half a century the technology has undergone a number of changes and refinements. Initially, X-ray images were captured on film. Today X-ray breast images are directly captured by arrays of small X-ray detectors which convert intensity of X-rays incident on the detectors to electrical signals. The electrical signals are digitized to provide digital representations of the images that are stored in computers for later diagnoses. A relatively recent change in X-ray breast imaging technology that was made practical by digital X-ray imaging is referred to as spectral contrast enhanced digital mammography (SCEDM). In SCEDM a patient is injected with a contrast agent that is preferably taken up by cancerous lesions in the patient's breast. The breast is exposed to X-rays at two different energies, typically a relatively low X-ray energy at which the contrast agent is a relatively poor absorber of X-rays and a relatively high X-ray energy at which the contrast agent is a relatively good absorber of X-rays. The exposures to the",

The exposures to the high and low energy X-rays provide high and low energy X-ray digital images respectively of the breast. The images are digitally subtracted to provide a “subtracted image” in which concentrations of the contrast agent in the breast, and thereby malignant lesions in the breast, generally have enhanced contrast and visibility. In particular, for dense breast tissues, known to be relatively opaque in classical mammography, normal breast tissue becomes substantially transparent in the subtracted image, enhancing contrast of lesions that in conventional non-subtracted X-ray images may be difficult to discern. Typically, the contrast agent used to acquire the high and low X-ray images is an iodine based contrast agent, and the low energy X-rays have an energy below the k-edge of iodine and the high energy X-rays have an energy above the k-edge of iodine. Although SCEDM has the potential to improve sensitivity of mammography, in practice, a relatively large number of biopsies is performed on lesions detected in SCEDM images that turn out to be benign.

The present invention relates to a process for producing a low endotoxin alkali chitosan, and also to a process for producing low endotoxin neutral chitosan, chitosan salt and chitosan derivatives, and to the products of such processes. Chitosan is particularly useful in the preparation of haemostatic materials for use in controlling bleeding. Chitosan is a derivative of solid waste from shell fish processing and can be extracted from fungus culture. Chitosan is a water insoluble cationic polymeric material. Before using chitosan in haemostatic materials, it is often first converted into a water soluble salt. This way, the chitosan salt is soluble in blood to form a gel which stems blood flow. Chitosan salts are ideally suited for the applications described herein as chitosan is readily broken down in the body. Chitosan is converted to glucosamine by the enzyme lysozyme and is therefore excreted from the body naturally. It is not necessary to remove chitosan from the body. Furthermore, chitosan salts",

Furthermore, chitosan salts exhibit mild antibacterial properties and as such their use reduces the risk of infection. In order to utilise chitosan in the preparation of haemostatic materials that are suitable for use in controlling bleeding, it is necessary to ensure that the chitosan has a sufficiently low concentration of endotoxin. Endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide existing on the surface of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Endotoxins are highly toxic to mammals, particularly humans, and are notoriously difficult to remove from materials. Endotoxins may become pyrogenic when released into the bloodstream or other tissue where they are not usually found. Thus, endotoxin must be removed from pharmaceutically acceptable products. Treatments to remove or destroy pyrogens, particularly endotoxin, are referred to as methods of ‘depyrogenation’. Techniques for the depyrogenation of materials containing endotoxin include ion exchange chromatography, ultrafiltration, distillation and various chemical processes aimed at destroying endotoxin.

The process of the present invention provides an effective way of obtaining an alkali chitosan, chitin, chitosan derivative or chitin derivative having a low endotoxin concentration. Advantageously, the process does not require a washing step, a rinsing step, use of a surfactant or phase transfer agents, sterile equipment and/or the use of endotoxin free water. Further, specialist air filtration or sterile conditions are also not required. The process of the present invention preferably does not comprise a step of acetylating the chitosan. Further, the process of the present invention does not use endotoxin free equipment. This is particularly beneficial as it reduces the cost of the process compared to processes requiring such equipment. By the term ‘chitosan derivative’ it is meant herein a partially deacetylated chitin, which may have different percentages of deacetylation, as desired. Typically, the partially deacetylated chitin suitable for use in the present invention has a deacetylation degree above about 50%, more typically above about 75% and most typically 5 above about 85%.

The term alkali solution is used herein to refer to a solution having a pH value of greater than pH 7.5. Since the molecular weight of endotoxins can vary significantly, endotoxin concentration is measured in endotoxin units (EU) per gram of material. The measurement of endotoxin concentration is a quantification of endotoxin levels relative to a specific quantity of reference endotoxin. For example, in the present invention, the concentration of endotoxin is measured in endotoxin units (EU) per gram of chitosan. The term ‘low endotoxin’ is used herein to refer to an endotoxin concentration of less than 50 endotoxin units (EU) per gram of chitosan.

The concentration of acid may be up to about 0.01M, 0.05M, 0.10M, 0.15M, 0.20M, 0.25M, 0.30M, 0.35M, 0.40M, 0.45M, 0.50M, 0.55M, 0.60M, 0.65M, 0.70M, 0.75M, 0.80M, 0.85M, 0.90M, 0.95M or 1.0M. The acid may be present as an acid liquor comprising the acid and a non-solvent. The non-solvent may be any solvent in which chitosan is insoluble. Typical non-solvents include ethyl lactate, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, ethanol, acetone or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the non-solvent comprises ethyl acetate or ethanol. More preferably, the non-solvent comprises 80:20 ethanol in water. Beneficially, it has been observed that the reaction proceeds at a faster rate using a non-solvent comprising an 80:20 mixture of ethanol to water. The ratio of chitosan to acid liquor may be from about 5 to 1 to about 1 to 5. Preferably, the ratio of",

Consequently, it is desirable to have as low an amount of acid salt in the resulting chitosan product as possible and, ideally, a level of acid salt which makes little or substantially no difference to the effectiveness of the chitosan product.

This also has the added advantage of not requiring the use of endotoxin-free water in a washing or rinsing step. It has also been found that using low concentrations of alkali solution as described herein causes less of a reduction in the viscosity of the chitosan when producing a neutral chitosan, chitosan salt or chitosan derivative. By low concentrations of alkali, it is meant less than 0.25M, preferably from around 0.01M to 0.2M. In some embodiments, the alkali concentration may be from 0.02M to 0.1M, preferably 0.05M to 0.1M. Good results have been observed using an alkali concentration of around 0.1M. In some embodiments, the alkali concentration may be as mentioned hereinabove. Beneficially, therefore, using low concentrations of alkali solution in the process is less damaging to the chitosan. It is therefore possible to remove endotoxin from chitosan whilst causing only minimal change in viscosity.

Online user navigation typically involves opening a new browser window or tab to access fresh content. When searching online for a particular item, the user may open a number of tabs on their browser to compare and contrast items he or she may find online based on, for example, a model, a make, a size, a price, and so forth. The user may also open tabs for items that are provided from different websites. This process is manually driven, difficult, and can be very time-consuming. Often, the user may lose track of which tab or window includes the items he or she is interested in.

During the aging process the skin experiences cellular breakdown resulting in a loss of thickness, formation of purpura (purple bruising), ease of tearing, and difficulty in wound healing, e.g., due to loss of collagen and fibroblasts. Aging of the skin is exasperated by exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation. Such exposure facilitates the production of free radicals especially reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS species expedite the aging processes of the skin and collagen breakdown. Cause of skin aging at the cellular level is a loss of connectivity by the collagen-stabilized fibroblast cells which connect each skin cell to the adjacent skin cells, and the subsequent formation of metalloproteinase-9. Collagen typically has the highest concentration of any protein found within the human body. Collagen is composed of three amino acid chains, bound together by sulfur. Certain compounds, such as retinoids in pharmaceutical concentrations, have been historically used to help alleviate these conditions. Unfortunately, retinoid compounds present difficulties to the skin such as inflammation (redness), and burning and peeling when used in higher concentrations.

The National Pretreatment Program implements Clean Water Act requirements to control pollutants that are introduced into publically-owned treatment works (“POTWs”). As part of this program, EPA has promulgated General Pretreatment Regulations that require the establishment of State and local pretreatment programs to control pollutants which pass through or interfere with POTW treatment processes or may contaminate POTW sewage sludge. Meeting these requirements may require elimination of interference caused by the discharge to POTWs of Fat, Oil, and Grease (FOG) from food service establishments (FSE). More specifically, the Pretreatment Program regulations at 40 CFR § 403.5(b)(3) prohibit “solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which will cause obstruction” in the POTW and its collection system.

Grease is problematic because it solidifies, reduces conveyance capacity, and blocks flow.” Controlling FOG discharges will help POTWs prevent blockages that impact CSOs and SSOs, which cause public health and water quality problems. FOG wastes are generated at food service establishments as byproducts from food preparation, and cleaning activities for pans, dishes, utensils and other surfaces. FOG captured on site is generally classified into two broad categories. The first type is yellow grease that is the byproduct of deep frying, and often captured in large containers, then ultimately sold into the reuse market. The second type of FOG, focus of this application, are the fat, oil and grease that are washed down the sink and floor drains into the Grease Trap. These fats, oils and grease are a result of cleaning pans, plates, utensils and other grease-laden surfaces in the food service establishment. The annual production of grease trap waste is massive.

Food service establishments create volumes of FOG that run from 800 to 1,700 pounds per year. Furthermore one source indicates that Americans produce 13 pounds of F.O.G. per capita per year. Food service establishments can adopt a variety of best management practices or install interceptor/collector devices to control and capture the FOG material before discharge to the POTW collection system. For example, instead of discharging yellow grease to POTWs, food service establishments often accumulate this material for pick up by consolidation service companies for re-sale or re-use in the manufacture of tallow, animal feed supplements, fuels, or other products. Additionally, food service establishments can install interceptor/collector devices (e.g., grease traps) in order to accumulate FOG on-site and prevent it from entering the POTW collection system. In many cases, an establishment that implements best management practices will realize financial benefit through a reduction in their required grease interceptor and trap maintenance frequency.

As a separate matter, large quantities of motor vehicle oils and lubricants also end up in water supplies for various reasons. Motor vehicle oils and lubricants thus fall within the definition of fats, oils and/or grease as used in this application. Pretreatment programs are developing and using inspection checklists for both food service establishments and POTW pretreatment inspectors to control FOG discharges. Additionally, EPA identified typical numeric local limits controlling oil and grease in the range of 50 mg/L to 450 mg/L with 100 mg/L as the most commonly reported numeric pretreatment limit.

Accordingly, the invention of this application employs a specially-designed container, such as but not limited to an absorbent tube or mat into which FOG can be introduced for collection, transport and consumed as a fuel product. In one example, an elongate tube or absorbent mat geotextile product is used to contain sphagnum peat or mushroom compost materials, and to maximize contact surface area with the FOG materials in, for example, a grease trap. The sphagnum peat, mushroom compost, and/or orange peels is obtained from select locations in the United States or Canada known for this type of specialized product. As used in this application, peat, mushroom and similar materials into which the FOG is absorbed are referred to generally and broadly as “capture materials” or absorbent materials.

Several products suitable for use in the FOG tube described in this application are “Dry All” wood fiber, sphagnum peat moss processed and sold by Integrity Absorbent Products, or shredded mushrooms. In particular, the peat moss product is an all organic hydrocarbon absorbent, manufactured from large fiber sphagnum peat moss. The manufacturing process produces a product which becomes both oleophilic, absorbing hydrocarbons and hydrophobic, i.e., repelling water. Due to its fibrous structure and processing, peat absorbs hydrocarbons quickly on contact by virtue of its wicking capillary action and encapsulates oil on contact. This makes peat ideal for hydrocarbon cleanup both on open water and land applications. Peat absorbs up to eight times its weight. This volume will vary based on the hydrocarbon being absorbed and the temperature. In certain aspects, orange peels have the same oleophilic and hydrophobic characteristics as those mentioned above.

Once trapped in the tube or mat, the product can be easily and compactly shipped to a location for disposal, incineration or further processing, including processing the materials for use as fuel. Sewage Sludge Incineration (SSI) is becoming a safe and effective alternative around densely populated municipalities where land application of sewage sludge is less desirable. One of the benefits of the sphagnum peat FOG absorbent tubes and mats is that they comprise a high BTU fuel that can be used to increase the efficiency of SSI processes. In addition to providing a better and more efficient way for collecting and disposal of FOG, the product can separate the higher density grease and oil so that it can be disposed of in a landfill, and/or burned as fuel in a sludge incinerator or other furnace.

During this step, the absorbent material having FOG absorbed therein is hydrophobic and will continue to float even when saturated with FOG. At this point, the technician may further utilize a positive pressure pump (a modified pool pump such as the Pentair line of pool pumps) to pump the biofuel (i.e., FOG laden absorbent material) from the top, or uppermost, portion of the grease trap and to remove the biofuel therefrom via a filter and/or physically remove (e.g., via a net or another similar removal device). During the removal process and while using the pump, the pump will beneficially circulate the brown water back into the grease trap thereby keeping the grease trap maximally efficient and effective.

The blower (controlled by a microcontroller, microprocessor or similar) pressurises the air stream from the flow generator outlet and passes this into the humidifier chamber. The air stream is heated and humidified in the humidifier chamber, and exits the humidifier chamber via an outlet.

Accordingly, in various fields, artificial intelligence, more precisely, the introduction of deep learning, is considered and prototyped. One cause of this widespread interest may be due to the improved performance of processors performing arithmetic operations. To improve the performance of artificial intelligence, it may be necessary to increase the number of layers constituting a neural network of the artificial intelligence to educate the artificial intelligence. This trend has continued in recent years, which has led to an exponential increase in the amount of computations required for hardware actually performing the computations. Moreover, if artificial intelligence employs a general hardware system including a memory and a processor which are separated from each other, the performance of the artificial intelligence may be degraded due to a limitation of the amount of data communication between the memory and the processor.

These problems are heightened by the difficulties in properly sizing implants: to ensure that a correctly sized implant is used, the doctor must be careful in selecting among available implants, and there are costs associated with carrying implants of multiple sizes to be available at the time of implant surgery. Accordingly, either the doctor or hospital must incur the cost of purchasing and holding in inventory a large number of implants of varying sizes to ensure that a correctly sized implant is available, or they must have a reduced number of implant sizes with the risk that an implant of the correct size will not be available, such that an incorrectly sized implant must be used with reduced effectiveness. Additionally, depending on surgeon experience, it may be difficult for the surgeon to select among available implant sizes an implant of ideal size, and",

Where this is done, however, either incorrectly sized, but tried, implants are contaminated and wasted, or are required to pass through a sterilization process before being reused, if even possible. Accordingly, such trial-and-error efforts result in increased costs to the surgeon and/or hospital, which must then be passed on to patients. Even when surgeons are able to use correctly sized implants, such implants still rarely have proper physical characteristics to promote bone ingrowth and to minimize problems with subsidence, endplate fracture, and/or stress shielding. Current implants are rarely shaped to conform to the endplates where they are placed. Additionally, current implants typically have stiffnesses that are significantly different from the stiffness of the vertebral endplates where they are placed, such that any nonconformities between the endplates and the implant lead to locations of increased stress and implant failure.

GIP and GLP-1 undergo degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), and rapidly lose their biological activities (see, e.g., Y Sieno, et. al, Journal of Diabetes Investigation 2013, 4, 108-130). The actions of GIP and GLP-1 are believed to be mediated by their specific receptors, the GIP receptor (GIPR) and the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), respectively, which both belong to the G-protein coupled receptor family and are expressed in pancreatic β-cells, as well as in various tissues and organs. GLP-1 activities include, without limitation, stimulation of insulin synthesis and secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and inhibition of food intake. GIP activities include, without limitation, stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion, an increase in β-cell mass, stimulation of glucagon secretion, and a decrease in gastric acid secretion. See, e.g., WO 2016/131893. GLP-1 and GLP-1 analogues, acting as agonists at the GLP-1 receptor, have been shown to be",

A partial agonist, when bound to the receptor, gives a response that is lower than that elicited by a full agonist (e.g., an endogenous agonist). Thus, the Ra/Ri for a partial agonist is less than for a full agonist. However, the potency of a partial agonist may be greater or less than that of the full agonist. In some embodiments, the chemical entities described herein further modulate (e.g., reduce, e.g., attenuate, disrupt, inhibit) β-arrestin coupling and/or b-arrestin signaling, and GLP-1R and/or GIPR internalization. In certain embodiments, the chemical entities described herein modulate (e.g., reduce, e.g., attenuate, disrupt, inhibit) recruitment of β-arrestin to a G-protein coupled receptor (e.g., GLP-1R).

The effects of the chemical entities described herein on β-arrestin signaling and associated downstream processes (e.g., those delineated above) can be assessed using conventional methods, e.g., PathHunter β-arrestin Assay for determining β-arresting coupling (see Examples section).

GLP-1, the native ligand for GLP-1R, and therapeutic analogs thereof, such a liraglutide, are potent recruiters of β-arrestin. As another example, a value of β-arrestin (GLP1R) EC50>1 μM (e.g., >10 μM) indicates a compound that does not substantially induce β-arrestin recruitment to GLP-1R.

Both GLP-1 (and the liraglutide analog) and GIP have been shown to produce rapid receptor internalization.

At present, there are mainly two deposition methods for organic Light-Emitting device (OLED) thin films, vacuum evaporation and solution process. First, the vacuum evaporation is suitable for organic small molecules, with good film formation uniformity and relatively mature technology, but requires large equipment investment and has low material utilization rate and low mask alignment precision for large-size products. Second, the solution process, which includes spin coating, ink jet printing, nozzle coating, etc., is suitable for polymer materials and soluble small molecules. It has low equipment cost and outstanding advantages in large-scale and large-size production. A special-shaped OLED display panel is a relatively unique display panel with special appearance of display. Its display area is a special-shaped area (referring to non-rectangular area, such as a circular area). The special-shaped area provides flexibility and",

However, for the special-shaped OLED display panel, an ink-jet printing area overlaps with an encapsulation area. During the ink-jet printing process, the encapsulation area will be printed with ink, which affects the adhesiveness of the encapsulation adhesive and encapsulation reliability, so an encapsulation effect of the OLED display substrate is poor.

Organic Light Emitting Devices (OLEDs) have been fabricated for a long time by vacuum deposition processes. Other techniques such as inkjet printing have been recently thoroughly investigated because of their advantages such as cost savings and scale-up possibilities. One of the main challenges in multi-layer printing is to identify the relevant parameters to obtain a homogeneous deposition of inks on the substrate. To trigger these parameters, such as surface tension, viscosity or boiling point, some additives can be added to the formulation. Many solvents have been proposed in organic electronic devices for inkjet printing. However, the number of important parameters playing a role during deposition and drying process makes the choice of the solvent very challenging. Thus, formulations containing organic semiconductors used for deposition by inkjet printing still need to be improved. One object of the present",

A major problem with split core CT's is that the measurement result is highly sensitive to the air-gap that always exists between the two parts of the core. Due to production tolerances, there may be significant variations in the measurement result between seemingly identical cores due to, for example, miniature variations, which may be at an order of magnitude of tens of micro-meters, between their air-gaps. Such variations of the air-gaps may be the result of differences in the force applied to hold the respective split cores in place, dust accumulated in the gaps, different corrosion of the cores, humidity, and other factors that may impact the gap between the parts of the split core. Moreover, such factors may also cause variations in the gap over time. As a result, such CT's cannot be practically used in applications requiring a high level of accuracy, such as, for example, revenue grade utility metering.

For example, real time values of measured analyte levels of a patient would allow for a more robust and accurate diabetes treatment. Moreover, a profile of a series of measured analyte levels of a diabetic patient can provide valuable information regarding the fluctuations and variations of the analyte levels in a diabetic patient.

For example, when two modular air cleaners are arranged in a stacked configuration rather than in a separated manner in a living room, the planar space occupied by the two air cleaners can be reduced. However, various modular appliances function independently even if they are attached to each other between the modular appliances. That is, in order to control a plurality of attached modular appliances, there is an inconvenience that a user has to input a user command separately into each appliance. The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the disclosure. No determination has been made, and no assertion is made, as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the disclosure. Aspects of the disclosure are to address at least the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below.",

For example, tissue ablation may be used to treat cardiac arrhythmias by at least partially destroying (e.g., at least partially or completely ablating, interrupting, inhibiting, terminating conduction of, otherwise affecting, etc.) aberrant pathways that would otherwise conduct abnormal electrical signals to the heart muscle. Several ablation techniques have been developed, including cryoablation, microwave ablation, radio frequency (RF) ablation, and high frequency ultrasound ablation. For cardiac applications, such techniques are typically performed by a clinician who introduces a catheter having an ablative tip to the endocardium via the venous vasculature, positions the ablative tip adjacent to what the clinician believes to be an appropriate region of the endocardium based on tactile feedback, mapping electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, anatomy, and/or fluoroscopic imaging, actuates flow of an irrigant to cool the surface of the selected region, and then actuates the ablative tip for a period of time and at a power believed sufficient to destroy tissue in the selected region.

Cardiac ablation catheters may incorporate high-resolution mapping electrodes. Such high-resolution mapping electrodes provide more accurate and more detailed information about the anatomic substrate and about the outcome of ablation procedures. High-resolution mapping electrodes can allow the electrophysiology to evaluate precisely the morphology of electrograms, their amplitude and width and to determine changes in pacing thresholds. Morphology, amplitude and pacing threshold are accepted and reliable electrophysiology (EP) markers that provide useful information about the outcome of ablation.

See, e.g., Wright, Chem. Commun. (2011) 47:4055-4061. This year, >99,000 people will die in the U.S. from healthcare-associated infections, more than all casualties from car accidents, HIV, and breast cancer combined, creating an estimated burden of up to $45 billion in U.S. healthcare costs. See, e.g., Klevens et al., Public Health Rep (2007) 122:160-166. The current crisis is exacerbated by the fact that most major pharmaceutical companies have essentially abandoned research in the development of new antibiotics. See, e.g., Projan, Curr. Opin. Microbiol. (2003) 6:427-430. The current rate of introduction of new antibiotics does not adequately address growing resistance, and with the case of international travel and increasing population densities, the need for innovation in the field has never been",

The macrolides are one of the few major clinically important classes of antibiotics for which the only practical access has been through semi-synthesis, or chemical manipulation of structurally complex fermentation products, in routes as long as 16 steps. See, e.g., Paterson, Tetrahedron (1985) 41:3569-3624; Omura, Ed., Macrolide Antibiotics: Chemistry, Biology, and Practice, Second Edition; Academic Press, 2002. The macrolide class of antibiotics has proven safe and effective in the battle against pathogenic bacteria since the discovery of erythromycin over 60 years ago. See, e.g., Wu et al., Curr. Med. Chem. (2001) 8:1727-1758. Erythromycin displays a spectrum of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria similar to that of penicillin but has a lesser propensity to induce allergic interactions, and has been routinely prescribed for upper and lower respiratory tract infections and urogenital infections.

See, e.g., Kurath et al., Experientia (1971) 27:362.

Agents Chemother. (1987) 31:1939-1947. Azithromycin has been shown to exhibit markedly improved efficacy against Gram-negative organisms, and has a longer half-life and higher tissue distribution than the other macrolide antibiotics, thought to correlate with its 15-membered ring containing a tertiary amine. See, e.g., Ferwerda et al., J. Antimicrob. Chemother. (2001) 47:441-446; Girard et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. (1987) 31:1948-1954. The natural product tylosin, a 16-membered macrolide used in veterinary medicine, has been shown by X-ray crystallography to occupy the same binding pocket as erythromycin and azithromycin, suggesting that there is a high tolerance for variability in ring size and composition of the macrocycle. The three primary causes of resistance to macrolides in bacterial organisms are ribosome methylation encoded by erm genes, mutations in ribosomal RNA or peptides, and cell efflux mediated by mef and msr genes.

Macrolides are an important class of antibiotics, and have proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of infectious diseases for decades. A critical component of erythromycin, and many other macrolide antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, carbomycin, cethromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, solithromycin, telithromycin, tylosin), is the desosamine or mycaminose sugar at the C5 position of the macrolide. For example, in erythromycin (shown below with the typical carbon numbering for a 14-membered macrolide), the C5 sugar is D-desosamine.

By means of the body part, the cannula tip can be fed transcutaneously to a nerve of a patient by medical personnel for treatment purposes, wherein the position of the cannula tip can be determined, inter alia, by electrical stimulation impulses. The electrical stimulation impulses are supplied via a stimulation cable which contacts the electrically conducting cannula tube in the region of a proximal body part of the cannula. Such cannulas are known, for example, from U.S. Pat. No. 7,022,115 B1, EP 1 002 500 A1 and DE 10 2016 110 379 A1 and are used in particular in anesthesia for peripheral nerve block. In therapy or in anesthesia, ultrasound is used more and more to observe and check the exact position of the cannula tip and the cannula tube,",

For this purpose, an ultrasound probe emitting ultrasonic signals and receiving the ultrasonic signals reflected by the metallic cannula tube is placed on the body surface of the patient. As a result of the improved ultrasound visibility of the cannula, as described, for example, in WO 2010/012 024 A1, the anesthetists are increasingly limited to the ultrasonic location of the cannula tube and dispense with the electrical stimulation. It has proven disadvantageous that the medical personnel on the one hand must hold the ultrasound probe for checking and observing the position of the cannula tube and, in addition, on the one hand control the supply and aspiration of a liquid through the cannula, in particular a local anesthetic, by suitable control elements, and on the other hand must set the electrical stimulation impulses.

In addition, in order to reduce power consumption in an organic light-emitting display apparatus or an electronic device connected thereto, a technology for driving at a low frame rate is applied depending on a situation. In this case, one frame period becomes longer, and changes in the luminance of the display element are more visible to a user. Embodiments include pixels in which a turn-off current of a switching transistor connected to a storage capacitor is reduced, and display apparatuses including the pixels. The technical features to be achieved by the invention are not limited to the above-described features, and other technical features that are not mentioned herein would be clearly understood by a person skilled in the art from the description of the invention.

This internal combustion engine is a direct injection engine that is used for start-stop vehicles. In order to improve engine start capability, the starting device is configured to detect the rotational position of a crankshaft when the engine is stopped and rotate the crankshaft using an electric motor (starter motor) while the engine is stopped so as to obtain a crank angle that is optimal for restarting of the engine.

In this early start control, when the engine is restarted, fuel injection and ignition are started from the cylinder that is in a compression stroke or an intake stroke while the engine is stopped by an automatic stop process (compression stroke cylinder or intake stroke cylinder).

In this example, by setting a crank angle immediately before an intake valve of a certain cylinder is opened to an optimal crank angle, injected fuel is introduced into the cylinder as soon as cranking is started, so that compression and combustion are performed immediately. Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2011-099357 (JP 2011-099357 A) discloses a technique in which cylinder identification is carried out by a crank angle sensor using a ferromagnetic magnetoresistive element (MRE) in a spark ignition internal combustion engine that performs an automatic stop process and an engine restart process.

Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2015-045247 (JP 2015-045247 A) discloses a technique in which when the engine is stopped, the stop position of a crankshaft is controlled to a position near a compression top dead center. In a powertrain system including an internal combustion engine for either or both of vehicle traction and power generation, the temperature of an exhaust control catalyst (hereinafter sometimes simply referred to as the “catalyst”) becomes high when the internal combustion engine is frequently in a high load range during its operation. In the case where the catalyst temperature is high at the time the internal combustion engine is stopped, the catalyst temperature may still be high when the engine is restarted. Catalyst deterioration tends to occur when gas with a high oxygen concentration flows into the high temperature catalyst. Accordingly, catalyst deterioration may proceed when air (oxygen) flows into the high temperature catalyst with rotation of a crankshaft immediately after the engine is started (restarted).

As a result, gas that is discharged in the first exhaust stroke of the compression stroke cylinder is burned gas, and the same applies to the intake stroke cylinder. The powertrain system having the early start mode thus reduces entry of oxygen into the exhaust control catalyst when the engine is started under the condition that the exhaust control catalyst has a high temperature. In the above aspect, the powertrain system may further include a rotating electrical machine coupled to the crankshaft. The control device may perform stop position control. The stop position control is control in which the rotating electrical machine is controlled such that the crank stop position is located within a predetermined range that is required to perform at least one of the first",

The specification of the above referenced patent application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The present invention, in general, relates to digital image processing and communication using digital pictorial images. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and a method for enhancing an expression of a digital pictorial image. New forms of communication have emerged through social and digital media platforms. Digital pictorial images, for example, ideograms or ideographs such as emojis, pictographs, stickers, etc., have changed the way users of multi-purpose mobile computing devices such as smartphones communicate with each other. Users typically insert digital pictorial images into messages, for example, instant messages, direct messages, chat messages, electronic mail (email) messages, short message service (SMS) text messages, etc. As part of everyday communication, these digital pictorial images project an expression succinctly and are used to convey ideas, nuances, emotions,",

These digital pictorial images evoke different reactions in different users in different geographical locations across language and cultural diversity. Many social and digital media platforms report an exchange of millions of emojis everyday through various user applications such as messaging applications, email applications, chat platforms, gaming applications, etc. Digital pictorial images insert tone, expression, and body language into a message, which would otherwise be mere, plain text. However, users who wish to communicate through emojis are restricted to selecting emojis from a limited set of emojis provided by a user application. These emojis are typically not interactive or have any effects that allow a user to convey an expression in a more interactive and optimal manner. Furthermore, these emojis are typically not adapted to convey expressions that are related to a context of a message or a specific culture or a geographical location. In conventional user",

Furthermore, these emojis are typically not adapted to convey expressions that are related to a context of a message or a specific culture or a geographical location. In conventional user applications, for example, messengers or chat applications, a user may be allowed to select an emoji to replace a word in a conversation without any interactive elements or effects. If a user wishes to share a large-sized emoji while chatting, the user typically has to download an image of the emoji from the internet and share the downloaded image. Hence, there is a long-felt need for a system and a method for enhancing an expression of a digital pictorial image on a graphical user interface of an electronic device to improve user interactions and meet interactive demands of device-based conversations such as smartphone conversations between users. Moreover, there is a need for a quick input method for sharing an enlarged, interactive digital pictorial image with media content, for example, animation, sound effects, etc., through a user application in real time.

The most common approach for pick-and-place operations is to use mechanical grippers having multi-fingered robotic hands and vacuum-based systems, also referred to as the grasping approach. However, it is usually challenging to use the same gripper to handle objects having different sizes, shapes, orientations, and brittleness. In addition, mechanical grippers typically involve high precision control of the robotic hand, especially in electronics manufacturing where the products are fabricated and assembled in microscales and nanoscales. Another approach for pick-and-place operations uses devices with tunable surface adhesion. This approach is attractive for pick-and-place operation in small scale because it can achieve high precision with less complicated control compared to the grippers. Viscoelasticity is usually used to achieve tunable surface adhesion. In this technique, the adhesion of elastomers can be tuned by controlling the contact/detach speed between the device and the target object. Elastomers can also have good mechanical compliance, thereby allowing soft contact with the object without damaging the object surface. However, the rate dependency of",

However, the rate dependency of adhesion control often limits the operation speed and eventually the production throughput. Moreover, the lowest adhesion of elastomers may still be too high to release objects onto some desired substrates, in which case complicated surface structures or additional chemical treatments are employed to decrease the adhesion.

The subject matter of each of these priority documents, including specification, claims, and drawings, is incorporated by reference herein. The present invention relates to a method for cleaning a paint spray gun. Conventionally, when an object to be painted such as a vehicle body is painted, a rotating atomization type paint spray gun is used in which painting is performed by spraying paint onto the object to be painted while rotating a rotating atomization head at a high speed (for example, see Patent Document 1). The paint spray gun requires color change and cleaning each time the paint color of the object to be painted is changed. The above-mentioned conventional cleaning of the paint spray gun has been performed by spraying cleaning liquid on the paint spray gun from an oblique direction.

When cleaning such a paint spray gun, it is necessary to clean not only the external face of an outer circumferential cylindrical body but also an internal face of the outer circumferential cylindrical body and an external face of a rotating atomization head covered by the outer circumferential cylindrical body with cleaning liquid. Especially in recent years, there has been a tendency to use a two-component paint composed of a base material and a curing agent or a water-based paint as a paint. Since these paints tend to remain on the external face of the rotating atomization head and the internal face of the outer circumferential cylindrical body, it is desired that the external face of the rotating atomization head and the internal face of the outer circumferential cylindrical body can be sufficiently cleaned when the paint spray gun is cleaned. However, for the above-mentioned conventional method for cleaning the paint spray gun, since the cleaning liquid is sprayed on the paint spray gun from the oblique direction, the external face of the outer circumferential",

For the rotating atomization head, only the leading end part of the rotating atomization head that protrudes slightly from the outer circumferential cylindrical body can be cleaned. To ensure that the external face of the rotating atomization head and the internal face of the outer circumferential cylindrical body can be cleaned sufficiently, it is conceivable to increase the number of cleaning nozzles and provide dedicated cleaning nozzles for spraying cleaning liquid between the rotating atomization head and the outer circumferential cylindrical body. However, in this instance, there is a problem that a cleaning device becomes complicated and large in size and the cost for cleaning increases. Further, it is conceivable to make a portion of cleaning liquid enter between the external face of the rotating atomization head and the internal face of the outer circumferential cylindrical body by increasing the ejection pressure of the cleaning liquid.

However, in this instance, since cleaning liquid, which has vigorously collided with the paint spray gun, scatters peripherally, a large amount of cleaning liquid which does not contribute to cleaning is generated, and cleaning liquid is consumed unnecessarily. In addition, it is necessary to provide additional facilities for taking measures against scattering of cleaning liquid, cleaning of scattered cleaning liquid, and the like. Therefore, similarly to the above, there is a problem that the cleaning device becomes complicated and large in size and the cost for cleaning increases. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for cleaning a paint spray gun which is capable of cleaning not only the external face of the outer circumferential cylindrical body but also the internal face of the outer circumferential cylindrical body and the external face of the rotating atomization head with less cleaning liquid, without complicating and enlarging the structure of the cleaning device.

This might be accomplished by decreasing feature sizes and/or utilizing three-dimensional array structures to increase the number of memory cells formed in a given area of a semiconductor wafer. However, such techniques can increase the RC (resistive-capacitive) time constant of conductive structures (e.g., access lines) used to access the",

The blade pre-form is then placed within an external mold where resin, which is either pre-impregnated in the fiber plies or added via a resin-transfer process, is cured. An expansion bladder within the blade pre-form, or one or more heat-expanding core elements, may be used to provide internal pressure to mold the blade into the shape of the external mold. The curing process hardens the resin so that the fibers become disposed within a hardened resin matrix, while the mold defines the exterior shape of the cured blade (which sometimes is integrally molded with a hockey-stick shaft). Composite hockey stick shafts are commonly offered in varying degrees of stiffness or in various “flexes” to meet the needs of players with different abilities and skill sets. Depending on the height, weight, or strength of a given player, for example, the player may choose a relatively stiff shaft or a more flexible shaft to enhance his or her shot-making or stick-handling skills.

Currently, IVR implementations in microprocessor packages, such as fully-integrated voltage regulator (FIVR) topologies, rely on air-core inductors. Typically, the air-core inductors are off-die, either on, or embedded within, the package dielectric adjacent to the microprocessor die. Industry trends and market pressures are forcing chip manufacturers to reduce package footprint with succeeding microprocessor generations. Space for the embedded inductor is reduced as well, causing decreases in inductor performance. In particular, the successively more compact air-core inductors have inductances that diminish from generation to generation, resulting in declining quality factor (ratio of energy stored in the inductor's magnetic field to energy dissipated by resistive losses in the inductor windings). As a consequence, the overall efficiency of IVRs suffer as losses increase.",

For example, FIG. 3 depicts a four-gate memory cell 310 comprising source region 14, drain region 16, floating gate 20 over a first portion of channel region 18, a select gate 22 (typically coupled to a word line, WL) over a second portion of the channel region 18, a control gate 28 over the floating gate 20, and an erase gate 30 over the source region 14. This configuration is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,868,375, which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Here, all gates are non-floating gates except floating gate 20, meaning that they are electrically connected or connectable to a voltage source. Programming is performed by heated electrons from the channel region 18 injecting themselves onto the floating gate 20. Erasing is performed by electrons tunneling from the floating gate 20 to the erase gate 30.

The erase operation (whereby erasing occurs through use of the erase gate) and read operation are similar to that of the FIG. 3 except there is no control gate bias applied. The programming operation also is done without the control gate bias, and as a result, a higher voltage must be applied on the source line during a program operation to compensate for a lack of control gate bias.

With reference to FIG. 5, prior art non-volatile memory system 100 sometimes creates and maintains protected area 501 within array 101. Protected area 501 can then be used to store configuration data, trim data, fuses, and other types of data that are essential to the operation of non-volatile memory system 100, which will be referred to herein as “system data” or “system bits”. User data will not be stored in protected area 501, and, optionally, protected area 501 is not accessible for read, erase, and program operations initiated from a source outside of non-volatile memory system 100. Because the data stored in protected area 501 is",

Because the data stored in protected area 501 is critical to the accurate functioning of non-volatile memory system 100, the data stored in protected area 501 needs extra protection from low-probability data loss events such as charge loss, charge movement, read disturb, radiation-induced soft errors, and other mechanisms which cause changes in the read current/voltage of a small fraction of the cells. One prior art approach is to store each system bit in protected area 501 in two non-volatile memory cells in a redundant fashion. In one approach, the read current from the two cells can be summed and compared against a reference value to determine the stored value. However, even with redundancy, in some non-volatile memory cell designs, charge loss, charge redistribution, disturb, or other physical changes in the non-volatile memory cells will cause the cells to flip predominantly from a “1” state to “0” state, or from a “0” state to “1” state depending on the architecture of the non-volatile memory cell. This can corrupt the system bit. For example, if one of two non-volatile memory cells flips from a“0” state to a “1” state, the total",

Spatially efficient storage, improved thermal management, and balance among battery cells, promote these goals. The systems and methods of this disclosure each have several innovative aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope as expressed by the claims that follow, its more prominent features will now be discussed briefly. The electrical and mechanical arrangement of the components described herein have several advantages over the prior art. For example, the individual battery cells may be subject to less cycling, thus increasing battery lifetime. The individual batteries cells may include terminals on only one end of a cylindrical body—simplifying manufacturing. The",

Propeller blades of a propeller assembly are extended when in flight in order to provide sufficient thrust to achieve flight in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV or drones). Propeller based unmanned aerial vehicles also may be referenced as rotary wing vehicles, for example, quadcopters. When at rest, propeller blades are often large and unwieldy in the extended configuration and thereby require significant space to adequately store the propeller blades and corresponding unmanned aerial vehicle. Conventional strategies to try to reduce an at rest propeller footprint have involved folding the propellers. However, these strategies require human intervention to fold and unfold the propeller. For example, an individual applies a force to fold propeller blades for storage or applies a force to extend the propeller blades for a flight configuration. In each instance, human intervention increases a likelihood of potential issues such as human error and/or subsequent improper mechanical setup of the propeller assembly.",

Photobiomodulation Photobiomodulation also known as low level laser therapy (LLLT), cold laser therapy, and laser biostimulation, is an emerging medical and veterinary technique in which exposure to low-level laser light can stimulate or inhibit cellular function leading to beneficial clinical effects. The “best” combination of wavelength, intensity, duration and treatment interval is complex and sometimes controversial with different diseases, injuries and dysfunctions needing different treatment parameters and techniques. Certain wavelengths of light at certain intensities (delivered by laser, light emitting diode LED or another monochromatic source) will, for example, aid tissue regeneration, resolve inflammation, relieve pain and boost the immune system. The exact mechanism is still being explored and debated but it is agreed that the mechanism is photochemical rather than heat-related. Observed biological and physiological effects include changes in cell membrane permeability, and up-regulation and down-regulation of adenosine triphosphate and nitric oxide.

(See, e.g., Karu I T, Low-Power Laser Therapy”, in Biomedical Photonics Handbook, Vo-Dinh T. Ed., CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., pp. 48-1 to 48-25, (2003)). Laser average power is typically in the range of 1-500 mW; some high peak power, short pulse width devices are in the range of 1-100 W with typically 200 ns pulse widths. The average beam irradiance then is typically 10 mW/cm2-5 W/cm2. The wavelength is typically in the range 600-1000 nm. The red-to-near infrared (NIR) region is preferred for photobiomodulation. Other wavelengths may be also used, e.g., UV light for neurons and green light for prostate tissue.

The LEDs are used for irradiation of surface injuries. A photoacceptor first absorbs the light used for the irradiation. After promotion of electronically excited states, primary molecule processes from these states can lead to a measurable biological effect (via secondary biochemical reaction, or photosignal transduction cascade, or cellular signaling) at the cellular level. A photoacceptor for eukaryotic cells in red-to-NIR region is believed to be the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain cytochrome c oxidase located in cell mitochondrion. In the violet-to blue spectra region, flavoprotein (e.g., NADHdehydrogenase in the beginning of the respiratory chain) is also among the photoacceptors. Clinical applications of photobiomodulation include, for example, treating soft tissue and bone injuries, chronic pain, wound healing, nerve regeneration, sensory regeneration/restoration and possibly even resolving viral and bacterial infections, treating neurological and psychiatric diseases (e.g., epilepsy and Parkinson's disease) (e.g., Zhang F., et al., Nature, 446:617-9 (Apr. 5, 2007; Han X., et",

An NIR treatment can augment mitochondrial function and stimulate antioxidant protective pathways. The evidence that the NIR treatment can augment mitochondrial function and stimulate antioxidant protective pathways comes from photobiomodulation experiments carried out using a laboratory model of Parkinson's disease (PD) (cultures of human dopaminergic neuronal cells) (Whelan H., et. al., SPIE, Newsroom, pages 1-3 (2008)). It has also been shown that light has both inductive and inhibitory effect on cell growth and division in a red tide flagellate, Chattonella antique (Nemote Y., Plant and Cell Physiol., 26(4):669-674 (1985)). When the excitable cells (e.g., neurons, cardiomyocites) are irradiated with monochromatic visible light, the photoacceptors are also believed to be components of respiratory chain. It is clear from experimental data (Karu, T. I., (2002). Low-power laser therapy. In: CRC Biomedical Photonics Handbook, T.

Later, similar irradiation experiments were performed with neurons in connection with low-power laser therapy. It was shown in 80's that He—Ne laser radiation alters the firing pattern of nerves; it was also found that transcutaneous irradiation with HeNe laser mimicked the effect of peripheral stimulation of a behavioral reflex. These findings were found to be connected with pain therapy (Karu T I, et al., (2002)). When photoacceptors absorb photons, electronic excitation followed by photochemical reactions occurring from lower excitation states (first singlet and triplet) take place. It is also known that electronic excitation of absorbing centers alters their redox properties. Until yet, five primary reactions have been discussed in literature (Karu T I, et al., (2002)). Two of them are connected with alteration of redox properties and two mechanisms involve generation of reactive oxygen species (ROE). Also, induction of local transient (very short time) heating of absorbing chromophores is possible. Details of these mechanisms can be found in (Karu T I, et. al., (2002); Karu T I, et al., (1998).

Gordon and Breach Sci. Publ., London). Photobiological action via activation of respiratory chain is believed to be a general mechanism occurring in cells. Crucial events of this type of cell metabolism activation are occurring due to a shift of cellular redox potential into more oxidized direction as well as due to ATP extra synthesis. Susceptibility to irradiation and capability for activation depend on physiological status of irradiated cells: the cells, which overall redox potential is shifted to more reduced state (example: some pathological conditions) are more sensitive to the irradiation. The specificity of final photobiological response is determined not at the level of primary reactions in the respiratory chain but at the transcription level during cellular signaling cascades. In some cells, only partial activation of cell metabolism happens by this mechanism (example: redox priming of lymphocytes). Far red and NIR radiation have been shown to promote wound healing, e.g., infected, ischemic, and hypoxic wounds (Wong-Reley, W T T, JBC, 280(6):4761-4771 (2005)).

Red-to-NIR radiation also protects the retina against the toxic actions of methanol-derived formic acid in a rodent model of methanol toxicity and may enhance recovery from retinal injury and other ocular diseases in which mitochondrial dysfunction is postulated to play a role (Eells J T., PNAS, 100(6):3439-44 (2003)). Other clinical applications of photobiomodulation is repair of soft and bone tissues by IR laser irradiation (Martinez M E, et al., Laser in Med. Sci., 2007). Invasive laser assisted liposuction is a recently developed method, wherein a laser fiber is introduced through a tube into the skin and directly to the fat cells causing the cells to rapture and drain away as liquid (Kim K H, Dermatol. Surg., 32(2):241-48 (2006)). Tissue around the area is coagulated.

Yet, another area of application of photobiomodulation is a direct control (or modulation) of brain cell activity with light. The technique is based upon NIR spectroscopy and is simpler to use and less expensive than other methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. Photostimulation can be used to activate a light-sensitive protein such as rhodopsin (ChR2), which can then excite the cell expressing the opsin. It has been shown that channelrhodopsin-2, a monolithic protein containing a light sensor and a cation channel, provides electrical stimulation of appropriate speed and magnitude to activate neuronal spike firing. Recently, photoinhibition, the inhibition of neural activity with light, has become feasible with the application of molecules such as the light-activated chloride pump halorhodopsin to neural control. Together, blue-light activated channelrhodopsin-2 and the yellow light-activated chloride pump halorhodopsin enable multiple-color, optical activation and silencing of neural activity.

ChR2 photostimulation involves genetic targeting ChR2 to neurons and light pulsing the neurons expressing ChR2 protein. The experiments have been conducted in vitro and in vivo in mice by in vivo deep-brain photostimulation using optical fibers to deliver light into the lateral hypothalamus (Adamantidis A R, et al., Nature 450:420-425 (2007)). Genetic targeting of ChR2 allows exclusive stimulation of defined cellular subsets and avoids the need for addition of the caged glutamate, facilitating photostimulation in vivo (Wang H., et al., PNAS, 104(19):8143-48 (2007)). ChR2 photostimulation has been used for restoring visual activity in mice with impaired vision, to evoke behavioral responses in worms and flies (Wang H., et al., 2007). The robust associative learning induced by ChR2-assisted photostimulaiton in mice opens the door to study the circuit basis of perception and cognition in vivo (Huber D., et al., 2007).

Another gene, chloride pump (NpHR), which is borrowed from a microbe called an archaebacterium, can make neurons less active in the presence of yellow light. Combined, the two genes ChR2 and NpHR can now make neurons obey pulses of light like drivers obey a traffic signal: Blue means “go” (emit a signal), and yellow means “stop” (don't emit). Light-sensitive proteins can be introduced into cells or live subjects via a number of techniques including electroporation, DNA microinjection, viral delivery, liposomal transfection and calcium-phosphate precipitation. A third photostimulation technique is chemical modification of ion channels and receptors to render them light-responsive. Some of the most fundamental signaling mechanisms in a cell involve the release and uptake of Ca2+ ions. Ca2+ is involved in controlling fertilization, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, synaptic plasticity, memory,",

Directly controlling a brain cell activity with light is a novel means for experimenting with neural circuits and could lead to therapies for some disorders. This accomplishment is a step toward the goal of mapping neural circuit dynamics on a millisecond timescale to see if impairments in these dynamics underlie severe psychiatric symptoms. In living organisms, scientists were able to cause worms, C. elegans, to stop swimming while their genetically altered motor neurons were exposed to pulses of yellow light intensified through a microscope. In some experiments, exposure to blue light caused the worms to wiggle in ways they weren't moving while unperturbed. When the lights were turned off, the worms resumed their normal behavior.

Other experiments showed that cells appear to suffer no ill effects from exposure to the light. They resume their normal function once the exposure ends. The most direct application of an optical neuron control is experimenting with neural circuits to determine why unhealthy ones fail and how healthy ones work. In patients with Parkinson's disease, for example, researchers have shown that electrical “deep brain stimulation” of cells can help patients. By allowing researchers to selectively stimulate or dampen different neurons in the brain, the light stimulation techniques could help in determining which particular neurons are benefiting from deep brain stimulation. Another potential application involves simulating neural communications.

A low-intensity laser light-oxygen cancer therapy is another application of photobiomodulation. The light-oxygen effect (LOE), which involves activation of or damage to biosystems by optical radiation at low optical doses by direct photoexcitation of molecular oxygen dissolved in a biosystem so that it is converted to the singlet state, i.e., by photogeneration of molecular singlet oxygen from 02 dissolved in cells, similar to photodynamic effect (Zakharov S D, et al., Quantum Electronics, 29(12):1031-53 (1999)).

Problems with LLLT, Cold Laser Therapy, and Laser Biostimulation The laser systems currently used for biostimulation do not allow performing photobiomodulation in a region deep within thick tissue without a surgical invasion. Laser therapy is mostly conducted in surface or near surface target cells and tissue because penetration of UV and red-to-N IR radiation used for photobiomodulation and photobiostimulaiton is no more than a few centimeters beneath the surface of the skin. In addition, imaging and stimulation of brain cells is mainly possible in thin brain slices, or a thin monolayer or suspension of cells. For deeper tissue laser therapy in situ, a subject undergoes various invasive surgical procedures, e.g., invasive insertion of a fiber via incisions into a fat layer or veins, implanting a radiation source in deep tissue, or implanting a glass window above the barrel cortex (Huber D., et al., Nature, 451:61-66 (2007)).

It is further well recognized that another problem associated with the existing methods of photobiomodulation is in differentiation of normal cells from target cells. Phototherapy There are two main types of reactions in phototherapy: (1) Type I reactions involve electrons and hydrogen atoms, which are transferred between photo-active molecules (also called photosensitizers) and substrates or solvent molecules. Oxygen may participate in subsequent reactions: e.g., psoralens in photopheresis and PUVA. (2) Type II reactions involve singlet oxygen formation by energy transfer from PA molecules in the lowest triplet state to oxygen in the ground state: e.g., photodynamic therapy (PDT) Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment modality that uses a photosensitizing agent and laser light to kill cells. PDT is a relatively new light-based treatment, which has recently been approved by the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of both early and late-stage lung cancer.

An important mechanism associated with PDT drug activity involves apoptosis in cells. Upon absorption of light, the photosensitiser (PS) initiates chemical reactions that lead to the direct or indirect production of cytotoxic species such as radicals and singlet oxygen. The reaction of the cytotoxic species with subcellular organelles and macromolecules (proteins, DNA, etc) lead to apoptosis and/or necrosis of the cells hosting the PDT drug. The preferential accumulation of PDT drug molecules in cancer cells combined with the localized delivery of light to the tumor, results in the selective destruction of the cancerous lesion. Compared to other traditional anticancer therapies, PDT does not involve generalized destruction of healthy cells. In addition to direct cell killing, PDT can also act on the vasculature, reducing blood flow to the tumor causing its necrosis. In particular cases it can be used as a less invasive alternative to surgery. There are several chemical species used for PDT including porphyrin-based sensitizers.

A purified hematoporphyrin derivative, Photofrin®, has received approval of the US Food and Drug Administration. Porphyrins are generally used for tumors on or just under the skin or on the lining of internal organs or cavities because theses drug molecules absorbs light shorter than 640 nm in wavelength. For tumors occurring deep in tissue, second generation sensitizers, which have absorbance in the NIR region, such as porphyrin-based systems [R. K. Pandey, “Synthetic Strategies in designing Porphyrin-Based Photosensitizers’, in Biomedical Photonics Handbook, Vo-Dinh T., Ed., CRC Press, Boca Raton Fla. (2003)], chlorines, phthalocyanine, and naphthalocyanine have been investigated. PDT retains several photosensitizers in tumors for a longer time than in normal tissues, thus offering potential improvement in treatment selectivity.

Photodynamic therapy uses light of a specific wavelength to activate the photosensitizing agent. Various light sources have been developed for PDT, which include dye lasers and diode lasers. Light generated by lasers can be coupled to optical fibers that allow the light to be transmitted to the desired site. See Pass 1-11, “Photodynamic therapy in oncology: mechanisms and clinical use,” J Natl Cancer Inst 1993, 85:443-456. According to researchers, the cytotoxic effect of PDT is the result of photooxidation reactions, as disclosed in Foote C S, “Mechanisms of photooxygenation,” Proa Clin Biol Res 1984, 170:3-18. Light causes excitation of the photosensitizer, in the presence of oxygen, to produce various toxic species, such as singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, when laser light is administered via external illumination of tissue surfaces, the treatment effect of PDT is confined to a few millimeters (i.e. superficial). The reason for this superficial limitation is",

The reason for this superficial limitation is mainly the limited penetration of the visible light used to activate the photosensitizer. Thus, PDT is used to treat the surfaces of critical organs, such as lungs or intra-abdominal organs, without damage to the underlying structures. However, even these treatments require significantly invasive techniques to treat the surface of the affected organs. Clinical situations use the procedure in conjunction with surgical debulking to destroy remnants of microscopic or minimal gross disease. It is possible that the laser light and small amount of remaining microscopic and minimal gross disease results in too little or highly damaged structures. Photopheresis has been successfully used for treatment of cell proliferation disorders. Exemplary cell proliferation disorders may include, but are not limited to, cancer, bacterial infection, immune rejection response of organ transplant, solid tumors, viral infection, autoimmune disorders (such as arthritis, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, Sjogrens syndrome, multiple sclerosis) or a combination thereof, as well as aplastic conditions wherein cell",

Of these, cancer is perhaps the most well known. Other successful application of PDT is, for example, cardiac ablasion therapy, e.g., treating cardiac arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation which are believed to be a significant cause of cerebral stroke. U.S. Pat. No. 6,811,562 describes administering a photoactivatable agent and subjecting cardiac tissue containing the administered agent to laser irradiation having a wavelength from 350 to 700 nm using invasive techniques, e.g., a fiber optic element. Yet, another application of PDT is photoangioplasty for arterial diseases including de novo atherosclerosis and restinosis (Rockson A G, et al., Circulation, 102:591-596 (2000); Hsiang Y N., et al., J. Endovasc. Surg., 2:365-371 (1995)). In human clinical applications, endovascular light (730 nm) is delivered through a cylindrical fiber after intravenous administration of motexafin lutetium.

Choroidal neovascularization leads to hemorrhage and fibrosis in a number of ocular diseases. Conventional treatments utilize the argon laser to occlude the leaking vessel by thermal coagulation. However, the percentage of patients eligible for this treatment is limited. PDT is used for treating AMD and involves injecting verteporfin followed by the application of non-thermal light at 692 nm. Improvement of clinical appearance of psoriatic plaques and palmopustular psoriasis using PUVA with hematopotphyrin was first reported in 1937. Acne, apopecia areata, portwine stains and hair removal also show promise with PDT treatment. In one existing treatment known as extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), excellent results have been observed since its initial approval by the FDA in 1988.

Long-term follow-up data are available from many investigators that indicate ECP produces disease remission and improved survival for CTCL patients. In addition to CTCL, ECP has been shown to have efficacy in the treatment of other T-cell mediated disorders, including chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) and solid organ transplant rejection. ECP use for the treatment of autoimmune disease, such as systemic sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, is also being explored. ECP is generally performed using the UVAR XTS Photopheresis System developed by Therakos, Inc (Exton, Pa.). The process is performed through one intravenous access port and has 3 basic stages: (1) leukapheresis, (2) photoactivation, and (3) reinfusion, and takes 3-4 hours to complete.

When these activated dendritic cells are reinfused into the systemic circulation, they may cause a systemic cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte-mediated immune response to the processed apoptotic T-cell antigens.

Researchers are attempting to use photopheresis in experimental treatments for patients with cardiac, pulmonary and renal allograft rejection; autoimmune diseases, and ulcerative colitis. U.S. Pat. No. 5,829,448 describes sequential and simultaneous two photon excitation of photo-agents using irradiation with low energy photons such as infrared or near infrared light (NRI). A single photon and simultaneous two photon excitation is compared for psoralen derivatives, wherein cells are treated with the photo agent and are irradiated with NRI or UV radiation. The patent suggests that treating with a low energy irradiation is advantageous because it is absorbed and scattered to a lesser extent than UV radiation. Chen et al., J.

Radiation therapy works by irradiating cells with high levels of high energy radiation such as high energy photon, electron, or proton. These high energy beams ionize the atoms which make up a DNA chain, which in turn leads to cell death. Unlike surgery, radiation therapy does not require placing patients under anesthesia and has the ability to treat disorders deep inside the body with minimal invasion of the body. However, the high doses of radiation needed for such therapies damages healthy cells just as effectively as it does diseased cells. Thus, similar to surgery, differentiation between healthy and diseased cells in radiation therapy is only by way of location. There is no intrinsic means for a radiation beam to differentiate between a healthy cell from a diseased cell either.

Transport capacity, for example cars, often travel long distances with minimal load (i.e., SUVs on daily commutes with only the driver occupying the vehicle). Such capacity is disused because of a number of reasons, including (a) an occasional need for greater capacity causes consumers to buy excess transportation capacity, (b) variations in schedule and destinations traveled create non-matched transportation needs compared with other household members, (c) lack of knowledge of trusted users who could conveniently use this excess capacity, and (d) difficulty in providing an economic benefit to incentivize the driver to share their excess capacity. Meanwhile, the driver of a vehicle often has no choice but to use a personal transport vehicle (despite the high costs involved) because of lack of accessibility, inconvenient scheduling, or multiple interchanges required if they were to rely on public transport systems.

The inefficient use of transport capacity results in approximately 3-4 times as many cars on the road as would be necessary if capacity were only 50% occupied. This has the additional implications created by the excess consumption of fuel in potential environment problems (CO2 pollution and global warming) as well as geopolitical problems (for example, many countries including the United States could be energy self-sufficient if they used their existing transportation capacity only 40% better (versus the 200+% better that could theoretically be achieved).

Inadequate “feeder systems” for the public transit network mean that billions of dollars are spent creating subway and rail systems that are massively underused, in terms of persons transported per hour versus the potential capacity of these rail systems. The flexibility of highway and road networks, along with the critical mass of car penetration and the marketplace dynamic of urban real estate value, however, means that wherever a highway is built, personal transport cars will soon fill it, creating further urban sprawl, with all the societal and ecological disadvantages that implies. Personal transport cars are common, among other reasons, because (a) the lack of availability of mass transit networks to serve the home or destination of the driver, (b) the inconvenience of waiting a long or unknown period of time for public transit, (c) fear of traveling with strangers or fear in waiting for long periods at public transit",

While even these systems can be improved, these examples show that if a Shared Transport system exists with sufficient timeliness and advantages, it will be widely used. These cities provide transit systems because these systems reduce their cost for infrastructure (i.e., building ever-larger and more inefficient highways) and increases productivity for their citizens and the companies in their region. So, cities have long sought to provide mass transit systems which take people from where they live to where they work and/or where they shop. However, since the popularization of highways in the 1950s in the US, cities have become increasingly suburban.

Another drawback to current carpooling systems, due primarily to the difficulty of co-ordination and lack of computing and communications capabilities, is that they assume the transport user must go to the same destination, or along the route of the transport provider. This is often suboptimal, as transport is often a “last mile” problem, and if one transport provider moved the transport user to another location where they could get directly home (using either public transport or the present system), the use of transport capacity could be made much more efficient, and vastly extend the possible reach and combinations of destinations. The present system, because of its ad-hoc nature and computational network model, can provide these transfer instructions to the transport user, and, importantly, providing graphical presentation of the reach of the transport network, giving confidence to the user that they won't be stranded.

OSA generally occurs during sleep when soft tissue obstructs the airway and creates cessation of, or impedes, breathing. Obstruction can occur at one or more levels including the retropalatal and retrolingual areas. Surgical correction of such obstructions remains a challenge, specifically for the retrolingual area. Removal or ablation of tongue tissue has been utilized with poor results due to complications, such as severe bleeding, abscess formation, and/or the inability to move the tongue anterior enough to relieve the obstruction. It is known that patients with OSA have a higher percentage of adipose deposits in the areas of obstruction, specifically, the soft palate and uvula, base of tongue and lateral pharyngeal walls. The adipose tissue may be up to or greater than 40% of the total volume of tissues in these areas. Removal of the fat deposits in these areas would permit relief from OSA symptoms while preserving surrounding tissue. To date, however, cryolytic treatment of OSA has involved procedures analogous to ablation, merely substituting cryolytic cold for electrolytic heat and nonselectively destroying tissue in a similar manner—and with the same complications.

The disclosed technology allows for the treatment of apnea by causing adipolysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue of the tongue without damaging the surface tissue. Cold temperature is delivered to the base to the tongue to invoke a cryolytic tissue response that triggers the apoptosis process within the tissue. To this end, the cold temperature is not of sufficient level and duration to cause immediate tissue destruction (often associated with ablation where the cell dies from necrosis—a form of traumatic cell death due to acute cellular injury). Rather, the apoptosis process is a biological response within the natural life cycle of the cell, also referred to as a programmed cell death. The exposure to the cold triggers the apoptosis process which causes the cell to naturally die over a period of time (e.g., over a period of several weeks and/or months), thereby reducing the size of the tissue that may be obstructing the airway.

Clinical treatment of spinal pathologies may include precise placement of an interbody to restore anterior column alignment with bilateral pedicle screw (BPS) fixation to stabilize two or more adjacent vertebral bodies adjacent to spinal fusion levels. Various iatrogenic pathologies may occur in association with interbody and bilateral pedicle screw placement. These pathologies may result from the surgical access window to the disc space, failure to precisely place the interbody along the apophyseal ring for quality cortical bone support, and/or failure to restore normal anatomical spinal alignment.

The instrumentation needed to provide access into the disc through a tubular approach, provide a valued decompression, complete a quality discectomy efficiently, insert and deploy an interbody, and insert the pedicle screw and rod construct also require a multitude of radiographic imaging throughout the procedure. This all increases surgical operating time, radiation exposure, and can result in the misplacement of implants and screws. There exists a clinical need for a robotically enabled procedure that provides pre-operative planning that is compatible with navigated, intelligent instrumentation that (1) establishes safe and repeatable direct decompression while gaining access to the disc space; (2) provides enhanced navigated, powered discectomy technique; (3) allows for precision placement of an expandable interbody that increases surface area contact along the apophyseal ring through the posterior approach; and/or (4) utilizes a minimally",

The present application relates to the field of semiconductor integrated circuit manufacturing, and in particular, to methods of making top of dummy polysilicon gates in a gate last process. With continuous reduction of process nodes in semiconductor integrated circuit manufacturing, a gate structure is commonly formed by superposing a high-dielectric-constant (HK) layer and a metal gate (MG), referred to as HKMG technology. One existing method for forming the HKMG is a gate last process. In the gate last process, dummy gate structures with dummy polysilicon gates are often adopted as a self-alignment technique to form sidewall structures, source regions and drain regions. Later the dummy polysilicon gates are removed, and then metal gates are formed in regions where the dummy polysilicon gates are removed. A hard mask layer is usually applied to define the dummy polysilicon gates, so it becomes necessary to remove the hard mask layer before the dummy polysilicon gates are removed. However,",

A hard mask layer is usually applied to define the dummy polysilicon gates, so it becomes necessary to remove the hard mask layer before the dummy polysilicon gates are removed. However, the removal process of the dummy polysilicon gates is usually performed after a contact-etch-stop-layer (CESL) and an interlayer film, usually the zeroth interlayer film, are formed. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the contact-etch-stop-layer on top of the dummy polysilicon gates when performing the chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process on the interlayer film, and the dummy polysilicon gates can be completely removed only after the contact-etch-stop-layer on top of the dummy polysilicon gates is removed. However, in the existing gate last process such as in the 28 nm note with HKMG process, usually a large horn is formed after etching the hard mask layer, making it impossible to completely remove the contact-etch-stop-layer on top of the dummy polysilicon gates in the chemical-mechanical polishing process of the interlayer film, resulting in leaving polysilicon residue at the gate, severely affecting device performance. To overcome the problem above, an existing method adopts a photoresist etching-back (PREB) process to remove the hard mask layer on top of the polysilicon",

After the first etching-back is completed, the photoresist 110 is only located in the spacing regions and the photoresist 110 outside the spacing regions is all removed. Because of the limitation of the etch selection ratio of the photoresist 110 to the hard mask layer in the subsequent second etching-back, the photoresist 110 will be thinned in the subsequent second etching-back. Therefore, one needs to consider the influence of thinning in the second etching-back on the thickness d101 of the photoresist 110 after the first etching-back, that will make the thickness d101 relatively large. When the thickness d101 is relatively large, a photoresist residue 205 will be formed on the side surfaces of the sidewalls 106. The photoresist residue 205 makes it easy to form a horn in the subsequent second etching-back process.

Generally, the second etching-back process completely removes the second oxide layer 105b but reserves the first nitride layer 105a. Because of the presence of the photoresist residue 205 after the first etching-back, a horn as illustrated and enclosed in a dashed-lined circle 206 remains after the second etching-back process. In the first etching-back process, although it is possible to decrease the photoresist residue 205 and thereby decrease the horn 205 by increasing the etching amount of the photoresist 110, the thickness d102 of the photoresist 110 as illustrated in FIG. 1D will also decrease after the second etching-back decreases the thickness d101. If d102 is too thin, the surface structure of the semiconductor substrate on both sides of the dummy gate structures cannot be protected.

The present application also utilizes the characteristics that the etch selection ratio of the spin-on carbon layer to the hard mask layer is smaller than the etch selection ratio of the photoresist to the hard mask layer, and can realize protecting the surface structure of the semiconductor substrate on both sides of each of the dummy gate structures, such as the embedded silicon germanium epitaxial layer, by adopting a thinner spin-on carbon layer in the second etching-back process, i.e., the etching-back process of the hard mask",

The peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is the peak amplitude squared divided by the root mean squared (RMS) value squared. The PAPR is the relationship between the maximum power of a sample in a given transmitted symbol divided by the average power of that OFDM symbol. In simple terms, PAPR is the ratio of peak power to the average power of a signal. It is expressed in the units of decibels (dBs). Large instantaneous PAPR generally occurs when, in a multicarrier system, the different sub-carriers are out of phase with each other. At each instant they are often different with respect to each other in phase values. When all the subcarriers achieve or approximately align in phase, the output envelope may suddenly shoot up which causes a ‘peak’ in the output envelope. Due to presence of large number of independently modulated subcarriers in a modern wireless system, the peak value of the system may be very high as compared to the average of the whole system.

The error vector magnitude or EVM (sometimes also called relative constellation error or RCE) is a measure used to quantify the performance of a digital radio transmitter or receiver. A signal sent by an ideal transmitter or received by a receiver may have all constellation points precisely at their ideal locations, however various imperfections in the implementation (such as carrier leakage, low image rejection ratio, phase noise etc.) may cause the actual constellation points to deviate from the ideal locations. EVM is a measure of how far the points are from the ideal locations. Noise, distortion, spurious signals, and phase noise may degrade EVM, and therefore EVM provides a comprehensive measure of the quality of the radio receiver or transmitter for use in digital communications.

Often ACPR is desired to be as low as possible. A high ACPR may indicate that significant spectral spreading has occurred. In telecommunications, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a type of digital transmission and a method of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies. OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for wideband digital communication, used in applications, such as digital television and audio broadcasting, DSL internet access, wireless networks, power line networks, and 4G/5G mobile communications. In OFDM, multiple closely spaced orthogonal subcarrier signals with overlapping spectra are transmitted to carry data in parallel. Demodulation is based on Fast Fourier Transform algorithms.

The primary purpose of a pig launcher is to launch the pig or tool into the pipeline system without interruption of fluid flow through that system. Pig launching (and receiving) systems vary from one to another depending on specific purpose and product. Those variations include such things as placement of valves, automated mechanisms, length of the launch tube or barrel, type of closure door, and the means to move a pig into the reduced cross-section area of the barrel (e.g. gravity, screws). Regardless of those variations, all launchers and receivers include the barrel, which holds one or more pigs or tools, and a large branch connection which connects the barrel to the pipeline system. When ready to launch a pig into the pipeline system, a tee section diverts pipeline fluid flow into the end of the barrel, behind one or more of the pigs positioned in the barrel. Gravity and dynamic pressure are used to move a pig into position for launching and to launch the pig. In some conditions, these fluid and mechanical properties are insufficient for launching and manual intervention is required. The launchers are not designed as an efficient fluids device, nor are",

The launchers are not designed as an efficient fluids device, nor are they designed so that a maximum force is applied where it might be most effective to launch a pig. Instead, fluid enters the barrel as a fluid jet perpendicular to the wall of the barrel. The momentum of the jet crosses from one side of the barrel to the other, diminishing most of the momentum and dropping its dynamic pressure to the pressure of the barrel without doing any immediate work. Additionally, the fluid flow is typically at a relatively low velocity due to the large diameter of the pipe branch or stub entering the barrel. For example, the kicker line is typically about one-third the diameter of the mainline (e.g. a 12-inch [30.48 cm] main, 4-inch [10.16 cm] kicker). Prior art launch units do not typically allow for fluid streams in excess of 7.3 feet per second (about 2.23 meters per second) and at most, in very rare occasions, 30 feet per second (9.14 meters per second), where pipeline product flow is in a range to support those velocities. Velocities in this range create stagnation pressures of about 0.3 inches (0.762 cm) of water column or 0.01 psig (about 0.07 kpa).",

Under some conditions, impediments to launching—such as oxidized metals and sand, debris, ice, and paraffin—can resist or impede movement of the pig. If the pig does not readily move into position for launching, the required pressure does not build behind the pig and the pig cannot subsequently launch into the piping system. In many cases the launcher will contain several pigs or tools waiting to be launched. Some mechanical means, such as hydraulically activated pins, must be employed to ensure all of the pigs do not launch at once. The cost to contain and control these pigs is significant to support the needed hydraulic cylinders, added weldment sites on the barrel, hydraulic cylinder attachments, hydraulic power units to power the cylinders, and controls specific to the hydraulics to control which pig is launched.

Streaming video over data networks (e.g., the Internet) has become increasingly popular as the availability of high-bandwidth Internet connections has increased. Video streaming refers to a type of video delivery mechanism where the data for the video is continuously delivered to a client device over a data network (e.g., the Internet) as the user is viewing the video. Video streaming allows a user to start viewing portions of the video without having to first download the entire video. Pre-recorded video content or live video content can be streamed over the Internet using streaming protocols such as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). Such streaming protocols typically divide video content into a series of video segments and generate a streaming manifest file (also referred to as an index file) that references these video segments. A client device can interpret the streaming manifest file to fetch the video segments and seamlessly assemble the video segments to play the video content.

However, this means that timed metadata is tied to specific video segments, which does not allow for individualized timed metadata for each playback session. One approach to individualize the timed metadata would be to store multiple copies of the video segments for each playback session, each having its own timed metadata embedded therein. However, this would quickly become untenable in terms of storage requirements as the number of playback sessions increases. Alternatively, with existing streaming protocols, timed metadata can be placed directly into streaming manifest files (e.g., HLS manifest file or DASH manifest file). This requires that the client side be able to properly interpret and process streaming manifest files that include timed metadata.

While it is predominantly expressed on the surface of cytotoxic T cells, the CD8 coreceptor can also be found on natural killer cells, cortical thymocytes, and dendritic cells. The CD8 molecule is also used as a marker for cytotoxic T cell population. There are two isoforms of the CD8 glycoprotein, alpha and beta, and each is encoded by a different gene. To function, CD8 forms a dimer, consisting of a pair of CD8 chains. The most common form of CD8 is composed of a CD8-α and CD8-β chain. Homodimers of the CD8-α chain are also expressed on some cells. The molecular weight of each CD8 chain is about 34 kDa. T lymphocytes are among the prime targets in gene therapy, even more so since chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have reached the clinic. Current approaches for T cell engineering mainly rely on ex vivo gene transfer methods. Following their isolation from either healthy donors or patients, lymphocytes are activated and subsequently transduced by lentiviral vectors. The modified lymphocytes are then expanded and either used in functional in vivo assays or used for in vivo applications. Ex vivo modification of T lymphocytes, however, has its",

The present invention relates to a vehicle body rear portion having a tailgate opening portion, and more particularly, to a vehicle body rear portion having a structure for improving torsional rigidity and durability performance of a vehicle body. A vehicle body to which a tailgate is applied has a quarter portion with a structure capable of mounting and accommodating a rear lamp. As shown in FIG. 14, and FIG. 15, a vehicle body quarter portion of a conventional tailgate vehicle is disposed above a rear wheel and on a side portion of a tailgate opening portion 101 and includes a lamp housing panel 103 on which a rear lamp 102 is mounted. As shown in FIG. 15 and FIG. 16, in the conventional tailgate vehicle, a quarter reinforce 104 is applied toward a wheel housing panel 105 in a vertical direction to secure rigidity of the vehicle body quarter portion, and the lamp housing panel 103 of a side external panel 107 is welded and coupled to a quarter internal panel 108, reinforcing the rigidity of the vehicle body quarter portion.

As shown in FIG. 17, when the rear lamp 102 is not mounted on the tailgate vehicle, instead of omitting the lamp housing panel 103 which is formed to be concave to mount the rear lamp 102 in the vehicle body quarter portion, in consideration of a vehicle body design, an extension panel 109 is applied which is not welded and coupled to the quarter internal panel 108 and forms an empty space between the quarter internal panel 108 and the extension panel 109. However, as described above, when the lamp housing panel 103 is omitted, a welding connection between the quarter internal panel 108 and the extension panel 109 is impossible.

The use of esterases as degrading enzymes for hydrolyzing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is of particular interest. Indeed, PET is used in a large number of technical fields, such as in the manufacture of clothes, carpets, or in the form of a thermoset resin for the manufacture of packaging or automobile plastics, etc., so that PET accumulation in landfills becomes an increasing ecological problem. The enzymatic degradation of polyesters, and particularly of PET, is considered as an interesting solution to decrease plastic waste accumulation. Indeed, enzymes may accelerate hydrolysis of polyester containing material, and more particularly of plastic products, even up to the monomer level. Furthermore, the hydrolysate (i.e., monomers and oligomers) can be recycled as material for synthesizing new polymers. In this context, several esterases have been identified as candidate degrading enzymes for polyesters, and some variants of such esterases have been developed. Among esterases, cutinases, also known as cutin hydrolases (EC 3.1.1.74), are of particular interest. Cutinases have been identified from various fungi (P. E. Kolattukudy in",

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, systemic autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. It is characterized by symmetric synovitis leading to cartilage damage and joint destruction and can be complicated by numerous extra-articular manifestations. Given the presence of autoantibodies, such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), RA is considered an autoimmune disease. RA is generally a progressive disease with functional status decline, significant morbidity and premature mortality seen in established RA. The disease can occur at any age, with a peak incidence between the fourth and sixth decades. The goal of long-term RA treatment is disease remission. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), a heterogenous collection of agents grouped by use and convention, are the first line of treatment for RA patients. DMARDs are used to reduce joint swelling and pain, decrease acute-phase markers, limit the progression of joint damage and to improve joint function. DMARDs, most often methotrexate (MTX),",

DMARDs, most often methotrexate (MTX), are prescribed upon disease diagnosis (i.e., early RA), usually before the development of erosive disease and the deformities seen in established RA. MTX therapy is initiated if pain and synovitis persist (especially if function is compromised), and additional DMARDs (with or without steroids) may be added to achieve disease control. Unfortunately, only about ⅔ of patients respond to DMARDS, and DMARDs only partially control established RA disease. Radiological progression continues even in the 5-20% of DMARD-treated RA patients that achieve remission or clinical improvement that approaches remission. DMARDS also have many adverse effects (e.g., liver damage, bone marrow suppression and severe lung infection) that limit their prolonged use. Due to the inadequate responses and dangers associated with prolonged DMARD treatment, biologics have been introduced as second line RA treatments. In general, anti-TNF agents (Cimzia®, Enbrel®, Humira®, Remicade®, Simponi®) are the first biologics used in DMARD-failure and DMARD-inadequate responder patients, and a TNF inhibitor is often combined",

Unfortunately, 30-40% of patients with established RA fail to respond to TNF-α antagonists and the majority of those that respond initially do not achieve complete remission or lose response over time. Concerns have also been raised about the short and long-term tolerability and safety of chronic biologic treatment, most notably the reactivation of serious infections (e.g., tuberculosis infections), liver toxicity, increased cardiovascular disease, induction (or exacerbation of) demyelinating conditions, and increased incidence of malignancy due to TNF-alpha antagonisim.

However, a TNF inhibitor is usually continued unless it becomes ineffective or an adverse event arises, at which point a clinician may switch to either a different TNF inhibitor or a biological with a different mechanism of action (e.g., Kineret® [IL-1R antagonist], MabThera® [CD20 antagonist], Orencia® [CTLA4 fusion protein] or Actemra® [IL-6 receptor",

Scott et al. (2010) The Lancet 376:1095-1108. Given the aforementioned problems with current RA therapy, there is a need to develop new treatments for RA patients. Secukinumab, a new biological in clinical development for RA, is a high-affinity fully human monoclonal anti-human antibody that inhibits Interleukin-17A activity. In an RA proof-of-concept (PoC) study, patients with active RA who were on a stable dose of MTX were dosed in rising single and then 2 doses (21 days apart) with secukinumab at 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg intravenously. Hueber et al. (2010) Sci. Transl. Med. 2(52):52-72. Treatment with secukinumab resulted in rapid improvement of the clinical manifestations of RA in many patients compared to placebo. These data provide evidence that neutralization of IL-17A is likely to be efficacious in RA patients with active RA. However, since patient response to biological treatment is variable and it is desirable to avoid providing drug to patients who will be resistant thereto, we have sought methods of treating RA that first identity those patients most likely to",

Expression of a protein from one system (e.g., organism) in a different system is crucial in applications ranging from drug production to genetically modified food. We have developed a novel method to design genes that are optimized for protein expression in a given system. A gene's DNA sequence encodes a protein, and these proteins are produced, or expressed, to carry out the functions of the cell. Bioengineering can take advantage of the cell as a protein production factory in order to produce heterologous proteins not originally encoded by that cell's genome. As examples, the high demand for insulin for diabetic patients is met by transferring the human insulin gene to bacteria that can then produce insulin in bulk, and genetically modified Bt corn expresses a protein from a bacterium that confers insect resistance. However, a gene from one organism is not always expressed properly in another organism. Each amino acid in a protein can be encoded by any of up to six different codons, or three nucleotide DNA sequences, and different organisms favor different codons to encode the same protein. Use of non-preferred codons can slow down",

Use of non-preferred codons can slow down the ribosome, the cellular machine that produces protein, and prevent the cell from making protein. Thus, a ‘foreign’ gene sequence must often be modified to use the recipient host's preferred codons. The challenge, then, is to identify the codon preferences of an organism and to re-encode the protein of interest using a preferred DNA sequence. To date, the methods to solve this problem have relied on indirect measurements of codon preference, such as frequency of a given codon in the host organism's genome. Here, we take advantage of a method for measuring translation directly, combined with machine learning analysis, to learn the preferred codon sequences in an organism of interest. We use these results to design and demonstrate an optimized sequence encoding a protein of interest. There is a large and growing market for better expression of heterologous genes in commercial and medical applications.

Embodiments of the invention generally relate to a method and a device for automatic determination of the change of a hollow organ on the basis of medical images. Dilations of vessels in the human body are a severe risk for a patient, since these dilations, in particular in the aorta, may progress towards an aneurysm which may burst or cause other adverse effects such as heart attacks, kidney damage or stroke. Thus, early detection of such dilations is critical for many diseases, e.g. for the aorta, i.e. aortic dissection, aortic rupture, and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Left untreated, such diseases often have severe and potentially fatal consequences. Therefore, it is important to monitor the progression of a dilation of a particular organ. Additionally, in a post-operative scenario, e.g. after an endovascular aneurysm repair, sac shrinkage is considered to be evidence of clinical success. The problem also can be generalized to any hollow organ such as e.g. other vessels like the airways, or the trachea. Conventionally, changes of hollow organs are diagnosed",

Conventionally, changes of hollow organs are diagnosed by manual evaluation of medical images of a patient, e.g. ultrasound, MR or CT images of an organ under investigation. However, such dilations or shrinkages are often asymptomatic and are only detected after complications have manifested. Thus, it is not possible to diagnose such changes before complications have manifested, resulting in a delayed diagnosis or a failure to diagnose. At least one embodiment of the present invention is directed to to improving the known systems, devices and methods to facilitate an improvement in automatic determining the change of hollow organs. Embodiments are directed to a method, a device, a control device and a medical imaging system.

Generally, a gas turbine includes a compressor, a combustor, and a turbine. The compressor compresses air (intake air) sucked in from an air inlet to produce compressed air having high temperature and high pressure. The combustor supplies fuel to the compressed air and combusts the fuel to produce combustion gas having high temperature and high pressure. The turbine is driven by the combustion gas and drives a coaxially connected generator. Specifically, a plurality of rotor blades constituting a turbine rotor in a turbine casing and a plurality of stator vanes disposed in the turbine casing are alternately arranged along the flow direction of the combustion gas to form stages, and the combustion gas produced by the combustor passes through each stage of the rotor blades and the stator vanes to rotationally drive the turbine rotor. With rotation of the turbine rotor, the generator connected to the turbine rotor is driven to generate power.

By controlling the cooling air introduced into the disk cavity by the opening degree of a valve (cooling-air adjustment valve), the temperature of the disk cavity is kept below a temperature limit. Specifically, the supply amount of the cooling air is adjusted by controlling the valve based on a measurement value of the temperature of the disk cavity (see Patent Documents 1 and 2), or the temperature of the cooling air is adjusted by controlling the valve based on the temperature of the air sucked in the compression section or the output power of the generator (see Patent Document 3) to keep the temperature of the disk cavity below a temperature limit.

Specifically, the cooling air is used as sealing air which is discharged to the gas flow passage and mixed into the hot gas while preventing the inflow of the hot gas. Accordingly, when the cooling air introduced into the disk cavity is reduced as much as possible, the amount of the cooling air mixed as a result of sealing into the hot gas for driving the turbine is reduced. Thus, a reduction in temperature of the hot gas due to the cooling air can be suppressed, and the performance of the gas turbine is expected to be improved.

However, the use of the air bled from the compressor causes the pressure of the cooling air to change non-linearly depending on the operating state of the gas turbine. Accordingly, in the turbine, when pressure balance between the hot gas on the gas flow passage side and the cooling air on the cooling passage side, which are opposed across the seal member, changes so that the pressure of the hot gas is higher than the pressure of the cooling air, the hot gas flows back to the disk cavity. Further, when the hot gas flows into the disk cavity, the temperature of the disk cavity rapidly increases. Such pressure balance is also affected by aging change such as change of a gap of the seal member sealed by the cooling air. In order to reliably avoid a rapid increase in temperature of the disk cavity due to the backflow of the hot gas, it is conceivable to excessively introduce the cooling air to the disk cavity. However, the excess of the cooling air decreases the temperature of the hot gas and thus reduce the performance of the gas turbine.

The technology and implementations disclosed in this patent document generally relate to an image sensing device. An image sensor is a device for converting an optical image into electrical signals. Recently, with the increasing development of computer industries and communication industries, demand for high-quality and high-performance image sensors has been rapidly increasing in various electronic devices, for example, digital cameras, camcorders, personal communication systems (PCSs), video game consoles, surveillance cameras, medical micro-cameras, robots, etc. In order to acquire a three-dimensional (3D) image using the image sensor, color information of the 3D image and the distance (or depth) between a target object and the image sensor are needed. A method for acquiring information about the distance between the target object and the image sensor may be classified into a passive method and an active method.

In the packaging industry, it is often necessary to apply adhesive. For example, it may be necessary to apply adhesive to a package, to a container, or to a label. It is therefore useful to control the manner in which adhesive is applied. In particular, it is useful to control the amount of adhesive to be applied. An object of the invention is to provide a method and device that takes account of the properties of the adhesive when determining how much adhesive to apply. The invention is based on a method for controlling and monitoring an adhesive that an applicator, such as a sprayer, is to apply to a substrate. Examples include those in which one or more of the quantity, temperature, and flow speed. The method can be used, for example, for applying adhesive used on labels to be put on containers or packages as well as for applying adhesive for mutual adhesive bonding of containers to form multipacks of containers, including multipacks four, six, or eight containers.

According to the invention, the presence, and in particular the concentration or the partial pressure, of a constituent substance of the adhesive, such as a binding agent, a solvent, or an additive, is measured with at least one gas sensor, and the application unit, or “applicator,” is controlled depending on a sensor signal from the gas sensor. The terms “partial pressure” and “concentration” are to be used synonymously hereinafter. Ideally, an additive that is detected is a secondary substance delivered to the adhesive, such as a perfume or a substance that imparts an aroma. Ideally, this secondary substance has no functional property for the adhesive or the adhesion process. Accordingly, hereinafter the term “solvent” is also always to be understood as being such a secondary substance. In this way it can be determined, for example, whether the solvent or binding agent content of the adhesive has decreased too much in the course of usage, such that there arises the risk of a satisfactory adhesive result no longer being obtainable.

In this case a gas sensor identifies a decrease in the partial pressure of the solvent and/or binding agent as a result of observing a decrease in that gas' partial pressure. The application unit can therefore, for example, be stopped before reaching a reference value or limit value, if, due to the reduced content of solvent and/or binding agent, no further satisfactory adhesive result is to be anticipated. Conversely, it is also possible for the delivery of a binding agent and/or solvent to be controlled based on a sensor signal, which again delivers the highly volatile components to the adhesive, such that it remains constant over time in its composition, and therefore constant in its adhesive quality. In this way, an aging of the adhesive due to the vaporization or evaporation of highly volatile constituent is counteracted. It is therefore possible by way of the invention for the property, i.e., the composition of the adhesive itself, to be monitored as part of controlling of the application unit.

As an alternative, the system can also be stopped, operated at another capacity, or operated with a higher glue application, in order to compensate for the deterioration in the glue's quality. It would therefore be possible, within the framework of the control arrangement by means of the sensor signal of the gas sensor, for messages to be issued to the control device of the system and/or for the system itself to be controlled, for example to not start or to be stopped. Such an application unit is, for example, a spray application unit with a spray head as an application unit, which sprays the adhesive onto the container or onto a label, or a hot adhesive unit, with at least one application opening, as an application unit, which applies a drop of a hot adhesive onto a container in order to connect it to other containers.",

The invention makes it possible not only to check on the composition of the adhesive, but also to check on whether the correct adhesive is being used for a specific purpose. In this way, for example, different adhesives can be used for different purposes. If an incorrect adhesive is used for a specific purpose, this can lead to unsatisfactory adhesive results. Accordingly, by detecting the partial pressure of at least one component of the adhesive, in particular of a secondary substance, one can immediately identify whether the correct adhesive for the specified adhesion purpose has been introduced into the adhesive container.

This leads to the intensity course of the sensor signal decreasing over time. The derivation of the measured intensity over time can therefore be formed, and this value can be compared with a limit value. In this way it is possible to foresee when a specific minimum partial pressure will be reached from which point the adhesive will no longer function satisfactorily.

Depending upon the contact hearing aid, the system may also include an external communication device, such as a cellular phone, which communicates with the audio processor. An example of such system is the Earlens Light Driven Hearing Aid manufactured by Earlens Corporation. The Earlens hearing-aid transmits an audio signal by laser to a tympanic membrane transducer which is placed on an ear drum of a user. In such systems, it may be beneficial to add smart components to the contact hearing device in order to improve the overall function and/or efficiency of the system. It may also be beneficial to use alternative methods of transmitting the signal and/or the energy required to power the contact hearing device and/or electronic components on the contact hearing device. As an example, in some prior contact hearing aid systems, e.g., those using light to transmit sound to a contact hearing device positioned on the tympanic membrane of a user, it was beneficial to bias the transmitted signal in order to transmit both positive and negative elements of the encoded data (e.g., sound signal) from a lateral ear canal assembly",

The transmitted signal was then received, by, for example, a photodetector, and transmitted directly to the vibratory load, e.g., a transducer assembly. In such systems, the bias consumed a significant amount of energy in the transmitted signal. In some devices, the amount of energy required for the bias signal was reduced by using a sliding bias. In such systems, the bias is changed according to the level of the incoming sounds, with a smaller bias for lower level input sounds and a larger bias for higher level input sounds. Unfortunately, the use of a sliding bias, while reducing the amount of energy required for the bias, does not eliminate the need for a bias signal, which consumes energy, potentially resulting in a shorter battery life or the need for a larger battery. Further, the use of a sliding bias may result in sound artifacts which are audible to the hearing aid wearer.

In these devices, the level of the output of the medial ear canal assembly was a function of the level of the input to the medial ear canal assembly. This arrangement could be disadvantageous because the output of the medial ear canal assembly was subject to change, by, for example, changes in the distance between the medial and lateral ear canal assemblies, which may be caused by, for example, the positioning of the lateral ear canal assembly in the ear. Further, in prior systems, such as those using light to transmit sound through the ear canal of a user or from a lateral hearing aid assembly to a medial hearing aid assembly, it may be difficult to obtain and maintain alignment between the transmitting element (e.g., a laser) on the lateral ear canal assembly and the receiving element (e.g., a photodetector) on the medial ear canal assembly.",

Operating in the polar domain, the DPS 106 modulates a (DC) power supply voltage VDD(DC) by an input amplitude modulating signal AM(t), to produces a time varying DPS voltage VDD(t) that follows AM(t). Meanwhile, the phase modulator 104 modulates an RF carrier by an input phase modulating signal PM(t), to produce a phase-modulated RF carrier. The SMPA 102 serves to translate the phase-modulated RF carrier to higher RF power, so that it can then be radiated over the air to a remote receiver. The RF output power POUT produced by an SMPA is proportional to the square of the magnitude of its DPS voltage, i.e., POUT ∝VDD2(t). This dependency is exploited by the polar modulator 100 to superimpose the amplitude modulation contained in the original input amplitude modulating signal AM(t) onto SMPA's 102's RF output RFOUT. In other words, as the SMPA 102 translates the phase-modulated RF carrier to higher RF power, it also modulates the RF output RFOUT by the AM carried by the DPS",

Although RF transmitters constructed from polar modulators can be made to operate with high energy efficiencies, one problem that arises from operating in the polar domain is that the bandwidth of the amplitude modulating signal AM(t) can be high, depending on the modulation scheme being used. For example, the modulation schemes used in Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) systems produce amplitude modulating signals AM(t) that tend to inflect abruptly when traversing to and from zero magnitude. As illustrated in FIG. 2, these sharply inflecting low-magnitude events 202 have substantial high frequency content, so when represented in the frequency domain are seen to have a very wide bandwidth. In order to accurately reproduce the low-magnitude events in the signal envelope of the RF output RFOUT, the DPS 106 must therefore have a wide operating bandwidth capability, preferably at least 5×",

It would be further desirable to have a DPS that has that same capability and that also operates with high energy efficiency. A wideband envelope modulator for a polar modulator is disclosed. The wideband envelope modulator comprises a direct current (DC)-to-DC switching converter connected in series with a linear amplitude modulator (LAM).

                    "text": "Niemann-Pick disease Type C (NPC) is a lysosomal lipid storage disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. Symptoms typically manifest beginning in the perinatal period and progress throughout life. The disorder often includes neurological symptoms, such as cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, seizures, vertical gaze palsy, motor impairment, dysphagia, psychotic episodes, and progressive dementia, as well as systemic symptoms in other organs, such as the liver, spleen, or lung. NPC has been described as a cellular cholesterol transport defect, although in the brain accumulation of other lipids, such as GM2 and GM3 gangliosides, also occurs (Vanier, 2010, Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases, vol. 5: 16). Owing to different clinical presentations and course of disease, NPC1 disease is typically categorized as early-infantile onset (<2 yrs), late-infantile onset (2 to <6 years), juvenile onset (6 to <15 years), and adolescent/adult onset (>15 years). Efforts to treat NPC in humans have focused on substrate reduction therapy, such as inhibiting glycosphingolipid synthesis, for example with N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (miglustat, Zavesca®), or on ameliorating overall lipid storage, particularly storage of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, through clearance",

K. et al., 1999, Molecular Biology of the Cell, vol. 10, pages 961-974). Hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrins have also been observed to have beneficial effects in animal models of NPC. For example, a composition comprising 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrins was reported to reverse defective lysosomal transport of cholesterol in the liver and brains of Npc1 knockout mice, and led to a prolongation of life in these mutants compared with no treatment (Liu, B. et al., 2009, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, vol. 106 (7), pages 2377-2382; Davidson et al., 2009, PLoS One 4:e6951).

Various hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin compositions have been administered to human NPC patients in the United States, Brazil, and Japan under compassionate use exemptions, with anecdotal reports of some improvement in various signs and symptoms. However, blinded clinical trials of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin compositions to determine safety and efficacy have not been completed (Ottinger, E. A. et al., 2014, Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 14 (3), pages 330-339). Given likely observer bias in the anecdotal reports, there is a need for controlled clinical studies to confirm that hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin provides clinical benefit. Effective treatment of NPC will require chronic intrathecal or intracerebroventricular administration beginning in infancy, and parenteral grade compositions of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrins used previously in human patients contain impurities that make them unsuitable for chronic administration directly to the cerebrospinal fluid of infants and children: propylene glycol, which is thought to be ototoxic; beta-cyclodextrin molecules having no hydroxypropyl substitutions, which are known to form precipitates and to have an acute toxicity (Muller and Brauns, 1985, International",

There is, therefore, a need for pharmaceutical compositions of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrins of higher purity. In addition, all existing parenteral grade compositions of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrins contain complex mixtures of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin species having different degrees of hydroxypropyl substitution. The ratios of these species within the mixture differ widely among the various suppliers, and vary even among batches from a single supplier. It is not known how these different species contribute to the pharmacological effects of the complex mixture. There is, therefore, a need for pharmaceutical compositions of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrins having more precisely defined and precisely controlled mixtures, or fingerprints, of such species.
