                    "text": "The present invention relates to a tyre provided with shoulder land regions in a tread portion thereof. In recent years, as vehicle performance is improved, there has been a demand for a tyre having excellent steering stability performance. From such a point of view, for the purpose of increasing cornering power, it has been proposed to decrease rubber thickness of the tread portion, for example (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2016-159788). However, the tyres configured as such cannot sufficiently absorb vibration during running by tread rubber thereof, therefore, it is possible that ride comfort performance and noise performance tend to be easily deteriorated. The present invention was made in view of the above, and a primary object thereof is to provide a tyre capable of suppressing decrease in the ride comfort performance and the noise performance while improving the steering stability performance. In one aspect of the present invention, a tyre comprises a tread portion comprising a shoulder main groove extending continuously in a tyre circumferential direction on a side closest to a tread edge and a shoulder land region formed on an outer side in a tyre axial direction of the shoulder main groove, wherein the shoulder land region includes an outer",

The present invention relates to bone fixation devices, and, more particularly, to sternal closure strap devices. Sternal fixation or closure devices are used to fix together portions of a sternum in a reapproximation medical procedure. Various surgical procedures require that the sternum is cut in half and separated before the desired surgical procedure(s) is conducted in the thoracic cavity. In so doing, the surgeon will conduct a partial or median sternotomy wherein a longitudinal incision is made in the sternum which then allows the portions, e.g. halves, of the sternum to be separated. After the surgical procedure(s) has been conducted, the sternum must be reapproximated using one or more sternal fixation devices to hold and secure the portions of the sternum together. Generally, each sternal fixation device will engage or otherwise wrap around the sternal portions in order to hold and secure the sternal portions together. A typical sternal fixation device comprises a stainless-steel wire. In operation, the wire is wrapped around the sternal portions or weaved within",

Since an error of the relative position estimated by SLAM is accumulated, position correction is essential. For the position correction, for example, a control device collects surrounding information with a laser sensor, a camera, or the like, and detects a position or a shape of a three-dimensional object that serves as a reference for position estimation. Then, a current position of the moving object is corrected by comparing the detected position of the three-dimensional object with map information (map matching). Therefore, if an error of the detected position of the three-dimensional object is large, it is difficult to correct the position of the moving object. In addition, when a position error is already large before the correction, it is difficult to correct the current position even if the map matching is performed.

Hemodialysis is the treatment of choice for >90% of CKD patients in the US. Without hemodialysis or some other form of renal replacement therapy, most patients with CKD would die. A typical CKD patient undergoing hemodialysis treatment must have their vascular system connected to a hemodialysis machine two to three times per week. For hemodialysis, there are three common vascular access site options. The preferred access site option is an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), which is a direct, surgically created connection between an artery and a vein, preferably in the wrist, or alternatively, in the forearm or upper arm. Another access site option is an arteriovenous graft (AVG), which is a surgically created connection between an artery and vein using an interposed synthetic conduit, preferably in the forearm, or alternatively, in the upper arm, chest, groin, or leg.

This means starting at the wrist for AVF patients and in the forearm for AVG patients. However, the smaller diameter of more distal veins often reduces the success of vascular access surgery in these locations. Unfortunately, about 85 percent of patients are ineligible for an AVF in the wrist, mostly due to vein and artery diameters that are too small. Furthermore, about 50-60 percent of all AVFs created are not useable without additional surgical and interventional procedures due to an occurrence commonly referred to as “maturation failure,” which is correlated with small vein and artery diameter. The availability of veins and arteries with larger diameters is correlated with higher AVF eligibility, lower rates of maturation failure, faster AVF maturation, and prolonged primary and secondary patency rates. Currently, there are few options for permanently or persistently increasing the diameter of a vein or artery.

Lower extremity ulcer is the most common form of chronic wound, with an estimated prevalence of 1% of the US population. About 2.5 million people in the US have a lower extremity ulceration and about 600,000 people seek treatment for a venous ulceration of the lower extremity each year in the US.

The median time to ulcer healing was 77 days (mean=108 days) and the mean cost of treatment was $2,400 per month. The mean total cost of treatment to heal an ulcer was $9,685 per patient. For patients requiring more than a year to heal, the average total cost per patient was $18,534.

In this embodiment of the outflow conduit tip, a stenosis within the tip is intentionally formed to create a jet flow that increases the WSS within the outflow blood vessel immediately downstream, causes vascular remodeling, and paradoxically promotes vessel dilation. This method mimics the mechanism of post-stenotic dilation (PSD) frequently observed in atherosclerotic arteries (Ojha, 1990). In Ojha's published in vitro studies using a pulsatile flow model, a stenosis with a 65% area reduction caused mean WSS to increase from a value of 1 Pa upstream of the stenosis to a value of 2.3 Pa between 3 and 5 vessel diameters downstream of the stenosis.

Fluorosurfactants are an important constituent in industrial process chemicals. Owing to their persistence and toxicity, these materials are problematic for users and the environment. Fluorine-containing surfactants can be employed in a very wide variety of applications and contribute, for example, to improved wetting of surfaces. Thus, they are used, for example, as interface promoter or emulsifier or viscosity reducer in paints, coatings or adhesives. Classical fluorosurfactants are built up from long-chain, perfluorinated alkyl chains (C6-C8) and are regarded as potentially bioaccumulative and toxic. In general, however, fluorosurfactants contain perfluoroalkyl substituents, which are broken down in the environment by biological and other oxidation processes to give perfluoroalkanecarboxylic acids and -sulfonic acids. These are regarded as persistent and are in some cases suspected of causing health damage (G. L. Kennedy, Jr., J. L. Butenhoff, G. W. Olsen, J. C. O'Connor, A. M. Seacat, R. G. Perkins, L. B. Biegel, S. R. Murphy, D. G. Farrar, Critical Reviews in Toxicology 2004, 34, 351-384). In",

Farrar, Critical Reviews in Toxicology 2004, 34, 351-384). In addition, longer-chain perfluoroalkanecarboxylic acids and -sulfonic acids accumulate in the food chain. Shorter-chain fluorine building blocks are more favourable with respect to their ecotoxicological profiles, but often exhibit worse properties in their areas of application. WO 2006/072401 and WO 2010/003567 describe surface-active compounds containing trifluoromethoxy groups. Further fluorosurfactants containing fluorinated alkyl groups are described in WO 2009/149807, WO 2010/003567, WO 2010/149262, WO 2011/082770, WO 2012/084118, WO 2015/124290 and WO 2016/096129. Furthermore, there is a need for alternative surface-active substances which preferably do not break down on degradation to give long-chain persistent compounds. Novel compounds have now been found which are suitable as surface-active substances and preferably do not have one or more of the above-mentioned disadvantages.

X-ray imaging of the human breast to detect malignancies has been clinically available since about 1970. As might very well be expected, since then, over the period of almost half a century the technology has undergone a number of changes and refinements. Initially, X-ray images were captured on film. Today X-ray breast images are directly captured by arrays of small X-ray detectors which convert intensity of X-rays incident on the detectors to electrical signals. The electrical signals are digitized to provide digital representations of the images that are stored in computers for later diagnoses. A relatively recent change in X-ray breast imaging technology that was made practical by digital X-ray imaging is referred to as spectral contrast enhanced digital mammography (SCEDM). In SCEDM a patient is injected with a contrast agent that is preferably taken up by cancerous lesions in the patient's breast. The breast is exposed to X-rays at two different energies, typically a relatively low X-ray energy at which the contrast agent is a relatively poor absorber of X-rays and a relatively high X-ray energy at which the contrast agent is a relatively good absorber of X-rays.

The images are digitally subtracted to provide a “subtracted image” in which concentrations of the contrast agent in the breast, and thereby malignant lesions in the breast, generally have enhanced contrast and visibility. In particular, for dense breast tissues, known to be relatively opaque in classical mammography, normal breast tissue becomes substantially transparent in the subtracted image, enhancing contrast of lesions that in conventional non-subtracted X-ray images may be difficult to discern. Typically, the contrast agent used to acquire the high and low X-ray images is an iodine based contrast agent, and the low energy X-rays have an energy below the k-edge of iodine and the high energy X-rays have an energy above the k-edge of iodine.

The present invention relates to a process for producing a low endotoxin alkali chitosan, and also to a process for producing low endotoxin neutral chitosan, chitosan salt and chitosan derivatives, and to the products of such processes. Chitosan is particularly useful in the preparation of haemostatic materials for use in controlling bleeding. Chitosan is a derivative of solid waste from shell fish processing and can be extracted from fungus culture. Chitosan is a water insoluble cationic polymeric material. Before using chitosan in haemostatic materials, it is often first converted into a water soluble salt. This way, the chitosan salt is soluble in blood to form a gel which stems blood flow. Chitosan salts are ideally suited for the applications described herein as chitosan is readily broken down in the body. Chitosan is converted to glucosamine by the enzyme lysozyme and is therefore excreted from the body naturally. It is not necessary to remove chitosan from the body. Furthermore, chitosan salts",

Furthermore, chitosan salts exhibit mild antibacterial properties and as such their use reduces the risk of infection. In order to utilise chitosan in the preparation of haemostatic materials that are suitable for use in controlling bleeding, it is necessary to ensure that the chitosan has a sufficiently low concentration of endotoxin. Endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide existing on the surface of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Endotoxins are highly toxic to mammals, particularly humans, and are notoriously difficult to remove from materials. Endotoxins may become pyrogenic when released into the bloodstream or other tissue where they are not usually found. Thus, endotoxin must be removed from pharmaceutically acceptable products. Treatments to remove or destroy pyrogens, particularly endotoxin, are referred to as methods of ‘depyrogenation’. Techniques for the depyrogenation of materials containing endotoxin include ion exchange chromatography, ultrafiltration, distillation and various chemical processes aimed at destroying endotoxin.

For example, it has been observed that chitosan gels to a lesser extent in saline solution than it does in water, and to an even lesser extent in saline solution at double concentration. Double concentrated saline solution referred to herein is contemplated as having an amount of sodium chloride of 1.8%. Consequently, it is desirable to have as low an amount of acid salt in the resulting chitosan product as possible and, ideally, a level of acid salt which makes little or substantially no difference to the effectiveness of the chitosan product. It has surprisingly been discovered that using an alkali solution having a low concentration, such as less than 0.25M and preferably from around 0.01M to around 0.2M, produces the desired low endotoxin concentration whilst also resulting in less acid salt by-product being produced in the subsequent process to produce a neutral chitosan, chitosan salt or chitosan derivative.

The process of the present invention can provide a chitosan product with a suitably low amount of acid salt without the need to wash or rinse the chitosan product. This also has the added advantage of not requiring the use of endotoxin-free water in a washing or rinsing step. It has also been found that using low concentrations of alkali solution as described herein causes less of a reduction in the viscosity of the chitosan when producing a neutral chitosan, chitosan salt or chitosan derivative. By low concentrations of alkali, it is meant less than 0.25M, preferably from around 0.01M to 0.2M. In some embodiments, the alkali concentration may be from 0.02M to 0.1M, preferably 0.05M to 0.1M. Good results have been observed using an alkali concentration of around 0.1M. In some embodiments, the alkali concentration may be as mentioned hereinabove. Beneficially, therefore, using low concentrations of alkali solution in the process is less damaging to the chitosan. It is therefore possible to remove endotoxin from chitosan whilst causing only minimal change in viscosity. It is desirable for the viscosity of the chitosan to reduce by less than about 25% in the process, preferably by less than about 15% and more preferably by less than",

During the aging process the skin experiences cellular breakdown resulting in a loss of thickness, formation of purpura (purple bruising), ease of tearing, and difficulty in wound healing, e.g., due to loss of collagen and fibroblasts. Aging of the skin is exasperated by exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation. Such exposure facilitates the production of free radicals especially reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS species expedite the aging processes of the skin and collagen breakdown. Cause of skin aging at the cellular level is a loss of connectivity by the collagen-stabilized fibroblast cells which connect each skin cell to the adjacent skin cells, and the subsequent formation of metalloproteinase-9. Collagen typically has the highest concentration of any protein found within the human body. Collagen is composed of three amino acid chains, bound together by sulfur.

The National Pretreatment Program implements Clean Water Act requirements to control pollutants that are introduced into publically-owned treatment works (“POTWs”). As part of this program, EPA has promulgated General Pretreatment Regulations that require the establishment of State and local pretreatment programs to control pollutants which pass through or interfere with POTW treatment processes or may contaminate POTW sewage sludge. Meeting these requirements may require elimination of interference caused by the discharge to POTWs of Fat, Oil, and Grease (FOG) from food service establishments (FSE). More specifically, the Pretreatment Program regulations at 40 CFR § 403.5(b)(3) prohibit “solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which will cause obstruction” in the POTW and its collection system.

FOG wastes are generated at food service establishments as byproducts from food preparation, and cleaning activities for pans, dishes, utensils and other surfaces. FOG captured on site is generally classified into two broad categories. The first type is yellow grease that is the byproduct of deep frying, and often captured in large containers, then ultimately sold into the reuse market. The second type of FOG, focus of this application, are the fat, oil and grease that are washed down the sink and floor drains into the Grease Trap. These fats, oils and grease are a result of cleaning pans, plates, utensils and other grease-laden surfaces in the food service establishment. The annual production of grease trap waste is massive.

Food service establishments can adopt a variety of best management practices or install interceptor/collector devices to control and capture the FOG material before discharge to the POTW collection system. For example, instead of discharging yellow grease to POTWs, food service establishments often accumulate this material for pick up by consolidation service companies for re-sale or re-use in the manufacture of tallow, animal feed supplements, fuels, or other products. Additionally, food service establishments can install interceptor/collector devices (e.g., grease traps) in order to accumulate FOG on-site and prevent it from entering the POTW collection system. In many cases, an establishment that implements best management practices will realize financial benefit through a reduction in their required grease interceptor and trap maintenance frequency.

As a separate matter, large quantities of motor vehicle oils and lubricants also end up in water supplies for various reasons. Motor vehicle oils and lubricants thus fall within the definition of fats, oils and/or grease as used in this application. Pretreatment programs are developing and using inspection checklists for both food service establishments and POTW pretreatment inspectors to control FOG discharges.

An example of this type of design is shown in WO 2004/112873, which describes a blower, or flow generator 50, and an associated humidifier 150. For these systems, the most common mode of operation is as follows: air is drawn by the blower through an inlet into the casing which surrounds and encloses at least the blower portion of the system. The blower (controlled by a microcontroller, microprocessor or similar) pressurises the air stream from the flow generator outlet and passes this into the humidifier chamber. The air stream is heated and humidified in the humidifier chamber, and exits the humidifier chamber via an outlet. A flexible hose or conduit is connected either directly or indirectly to the humidifier outlet, and the heated, humidified gases are passed to a user via the conduit.

Diabetes mellitus type 2 (type-2 diabetes) is characterized by high blood glucose and insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes as well as conditions that are co-morbid or sequela with type-2 diabetes affect tens of millions of people in the United States alone. Type-2 diabetes is frequently associated with obesity. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is liver inflammation and damage caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. It is part of a group of conditions called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NASH and NAFLD tend to develop in patients having one of the following risk factors: obesity, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance and appears to be linked to insulin resistance (e.g., as in obesity or metabolic syndrome).

Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (“GIP”) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (“GLP-1”) are primary incretin hormones secreted from small intestinal L cells and K cells, respectively, on ingestion of glucose or nutrients to stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells. GIP and GLP-1 undergo degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), and rapidly lose their biological activities (see, e.g., Y Sieno, et. al, Journal of Diabetes Investigation 2013, 4, 108-130). The actions of GIP and GLP-1 are believed to be mediated by their specific receptors, the GIP receptor (GIPR) and the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), respectively, which both belong to the G-protein coupled receptor family and are expressed in pancreatic β-cells, as well as in various tissues and organs. GLP-1 activities include, without limitation, stimulation of insulin synthesis and secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and inhibition of food intake. GIP activities include, without limitation, stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion, an increase in β-cell mass, stimulation of glucagon secretion, and a decrease in gastric acid secretion.

In addition to their insulinotropic effects, GIP and GLP-1 are believed to be involved in various biological processes in different tissues and organs that express GIPR and GLP-1R, including, e.g., the pancreas, fat, bone, brain, heart, kidney, eye, nerves, and liver. By way of example, investigations using mice lacking GIPR and/or GLP-1R, as well as mice lacking DPP-4, showed involvement of GIP and GLP-1 in divergent biological activities. The results of these investigations point to involvement of GIP and GLP-1 in treating and/or preventing diabetes-related microvascular complications (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications (e.g., coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease and cerebrovascular disease), as well as diabetes-related comorbidity (e.g., obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, bone fracture and cognitive dysfunction).

In certain embodiments, the chemical entities that are full agonists of GLP-1R and partial agonists or antagonists of GIPR; or that are partial agonists or antagonists of GLP-1R and full agonists of GIPR. Generally, a receptor exists in an active (Ra) and an inactive (Ri) conformation. Certain compounds that affect the receptor can alter the ratio of Ra to Ri (Ra/Ri). For example, a full agonist increases the ratio of Ra/Ri and can cause a “maximal”, saturating effect. A partial agonist, when bound to the receptor, gives a response that is lower than that elicited by a full agonist (e.g., an endogenous agonist). Thus, the Ra/Ri for a partial agonist is less than for a full agonist. However, the potency of a partial agonist may be greater or less than that of the full agonist.

Organic Light Emitting Devices (OLEDs) have been fabricated for a long time by vacuum deposition processes. Other techniques such as inkjet printing have been recently thoroughly investigated because of their advantages such as cost savings and scale-up possibilities. One of the main challenges in multi-layer printing is to identify the relevant parameters to obtain a homogeneous deposition of inks on the substrate. To trigger these parameters, such as surface tension, viscosity or boiling point, some additives can be added to the formulation. Many solvents have been proposed in organic electronic devices for inkjet printing. However, the number of important parameters playing a role during deposition and drying process makes the choice of the solvent very challenging.

Using such devices, or power meters for that matter, is deficient for the purposes of measuring relatively low currents in an environment of a plurality of circuit breakers. One of ordinary skill in the art would readily realize that split cores are used when non-intrusive installations of CTs is required, i.e., there is a need or requirement not to disconnect electrical wires when installing a CT.

A major problem with split core CT's is that the measurement result is highly sensitive to the air-gap that always exists between the two parts of the core. Due to production tolerances, there may be significant variations in the measurement result between seemingly identical cores due to, for example, miniature variations, which may be at an order of magnitude of tens of micro-meters, between their air-gaps. Such variations of the air-gaps may be the result of differences in the force applied to hold the respective split cores in place, dust accumulated in the gaps, different corrosion of the cores, humidity, and other factors that may impact the gap between the parts of the split core. Moreover, such factors may also cause variations in the gap over time. As a result, such CT's cannot be practically used in applications requiring a high level of accuracy, such as, for example, revenue grade utility metering. Other sources of inaccuracy in CTs (not necessarily limited to those having a split core) are the number of winding which varies due to tolerances of the winding process, variations in the core cross section dimensions and magnetic material properties.

Azithromycin has been shown to exhibit markedly improved efficacy against Gram-negative organisms, and has a longer half-life and higher tissue distribution than the other macrolide antibiotics, thought to correlate with its 15-membered ring containing a tertiary amine.

Ketolides such as telithromycin and solithromycin defeat the efflux mechanism of resistance by replacement of the C3 cladinose sugar with a carbonyl group (hence the name “ketolides”), and are thought to exhibit greatly increased binding by virtue of favorable interactions between the novel aryl-alkyl sidechain and the ribosome.

Macrolides are an important class of antibiotics, and have proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of infectious diseases for decades. A critical component of erythromycin, and many other macrolide antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, carbomycin, cethromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, solithromycin, telithromycin, tylosin), is the desosamine or mycaminose sugar at the C5 position of the macrolide. For example, in erythromycin (shown below with the typical carbon numbering for a 14-membered macrolide), the C5 sugar is D-desosamine. X-ray crystallographic studies reveal that the C5 sugar makes extensive contacts with the 23S subunit of bacterial ribosomal RNA as shown in FIG. 2, and thus it is thought that it plays a key role in antibiotic activity of macrolides.

The disclosure relates to powertrain systems. For example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2001-221138 (JP 2001-221138 A) discloses a starting device for an internal combustion engine. This internal combustion engine is a direct injection engine that is used for start-stop vehicles. In order to improve engine start capability, the starting device is configured to detect the rotational position of a crankshaft when the engine is stopped and rotate the crankshaft using an electric motor (starter motor) while the engine is stopped so as to obtain a crank angle that is optimal for restarting of the engine. JP 2001-221138 A discloses early start control for direct injection engines. In this early start control, when the engine is restarted, fuel injection and ignition are started from the cylinder that is in a compression stroke or an intake stroke while the engine is stopped by an automatic stop process (compression stroke cylinder or intake stroke cylinder). JP 2001-221138 A describes an example of rotation control of a crankshaft to an optimum crank angle which is intended for port",

JP 2001-221138 A describes an example of rotation control of a crankshaft to an optimum crank angle which is intended for port fuel injection engines. In this example, by setting a crank angle immediately before an intake valve of a certain cylinder is opened to an optimal crank angle, injected fuel is introduced into the cylinder as soon as cranking is started, so that compression and combustion are performed immediately. Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2011-099357 (JP 2011-099357 A) discloses a technique in which cylinder identification is carried out by a crank angle sensor using a ferromagnetic magnetoresistive element (MRE) in a spark ignition internal combustion engine that performs an automatic stop process and an engine restart process. This technique is in order to quickly restart the engine.

In a powertrain system including an internal combustion engine for either or both of vehicle traction and power generation, the temperature of an exhaust control catalyst (hereinafter sometimes simply referred to as the “catalyst”) becomes high when the internal combustion engine is frequently in a high load range during its operation. In the case where the catalyst temperature is high at the time the internal combustion engine is stopped, the catalyst temperature may still be high when the engine is restarted. Catalyst deterioration tends to occur when gas with a high oxygen concentration flows into the high temperature catalyst. Accordingly, catalyst deterioration may proceed when air (oxygen) flows into the high temperature catalyst with rotation of a crankshaft immediately after the engine is started (restarted).

The subject matter of each of these priority documents, including specification, claims, and drawings, is incorporated by reference herein. The present invention relates to a method for cleaning a paint spray gun. Conventionally, when an object to be painted such as a vehicle body is painted, a rotating atomization type paint spray gun is used in which painting is performed by spraying paint onto the object to be painted while rotating a rotating atomization head at a high speed (for example, see Patent Document 1). The paint spray gun requires color change and cleaning each time the paint color of the object to be painted is changed. The above-mentioned conventional cleaning of the paint spray gun has been performed by spraying cleaning liquid on the paint spray gun from an oblique direction.

When cleaning such a paint spray gun, it is necessary to clean not only the external face of an outer circumferential cylindrical body but also an internal face of the outer circumferential cylindrical body and an external face of a rotating atomization head covered by the outer circumferential cylindrical body with cleaning liquid. Especially in recent years, there has been a tendency to use a two-component paint composed of a base material and a curing agent or a water-based paint as a paint. Since these paints tend to remain on the external face of the rotating atomization head and the internal face of the outer circumferential cylindrical body, it is desired that the external face of the rotating atomization head and the internal face of the outer circumferential cylindrical body can be sufficiently cleaned when the paint spray gun is cleaned. However, for the above-mentioned conventional method for cleaning the paint spray gun, since the cleaning liquid is sprayed on the paint spray gun from the oblique direction, the external face of the outer circumferential",

However, in this instance, since cleaning liquid, which has vigorously collided with the paint spray gun, scatters peripherally, a large amount of cleaning liquid which does not contribute to cleaning is generated, and cleaning liquid is consumed unnecessarily. In addition, it is necessary to provide additional facilities for taking measures against scattering of cleaning liquid, cleaning of scattered cleaning liquid, and the like. Therefore, similarly to the above, there is a problem that the cleaning device becomes complicated and large in size and the cost for cleaning increases. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for cleaning a paint spray gun which is capable of cleaning not only the external face of the outer circumferential cylindrical body but also the internal face of the outer circumferential cylindrical body and the external face of the rotating atomization head with less cleaning liquid, without complicating and enlarging the structure of the cleaning device.

Optical communication networks, which use fiber-optic cable to transmit data between network nodes, are increasingly being used for data transmission, due to their inherent capability to support high bandwidth and to transport data over long distances. In an optical communication network, data is modulated onto an optical carrier generated by a laser to yield a modulated optical signal. One modulation scheme is direct modulation, in which the current driving the laser is modulated according to the content of the transmitted data. Direct modulation changes the refractive index of the material forming the laser's cavity, which results in a distortion of the modulated optical signal known is laser chirp.

The erase operation (whereby erasing occurs through use of the erase gate) and read operation are similar to that of the FIG. 3 except there is no control gate bias applied. The programming operation also is done without the control gate bias, and as a result, a higher voltage must be applied on the source line during a program operation to compensate for a lack of control gate bias.

Protected area 501 can then be used to store configuration data, trim data, fuses, and other types of data that are essential to the operation of non-volatile memory system 100, which will be referred to herein as “system data” or “system bits”.

Because the data stored in protected area 501 is critical to the accurate functioning of non-volatile memory system 100, the data stored in protected area 501 needs extra protection from low-probability data loss events such as charge loss, charge movement, read disturb, radiation-induced soft errors, and other mechanisms which cause changes in the read current/voltage of a small fraction of the cells. One prior art approach is to store each system bit in protected area 501 in two non-volatile memory cells in a redundant fashion. In one approach, the read current from the two cells can be summed and compared against a reference value to determine the stored value. However, even with redundancy, in some non-volatile memory cell designs, charge loss, charge redistribution, disturb, or other physical changes in the non-volatile memory cells will cause the cells to flip predominantly from a “1” state to “0” state, or from a “0” state to “1” state depending on the architecture of the non-volatile memory cell. This can corrupt the system bit. For example, if one of two non-volatile memory cells flips from a“0” state to a “1” state, the total",

Numerous embodiments are disclosed of improved architectures for storing and retrieving system data in a non-volatile memory system.

The LEDs are used for irradiation of surface injuries. A photoacceptor first absorbs the light used for the irradiation. After promotion of electronically excited states, primary molecule processes from these states can lead to a measurable biological effect (via secondary biochemical reaction, or photosignal transduction cascade, or cellular signaling) at the cellular level. A photoacceptor for eukaryotic cells in red-to-NIR region is believed to be the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain cytochrome c oxidase located in cell mitochondrion. In the violet-to blue spectra region, flavoprotein (e.g., NADHdehydrogenase in the beginning of the respiratory chain) is also among the photoacceptors. Clinical applications of photobiomodulation include, for example, treating soft tissue and bone injuries, chronic pain, wound healing, nerve regeneration, sensory regeneration/restoration and possibly even resolving viral and bacterial infections, treating neurological and psychiatric diseases (e.g., epilepsy and Parkinson's disease) (e.g., Zhang F., et al., Nature, 446:617-9 (Apr. 5, 2007; Han X., et",

An NIR treatment can augment mitochondrial function and stimulate antioxidant protective pathways. The evidence that the NIR treatment can augment mitochondrial function and stimulate antioxidant protective pathways comes from photobiomodulation experiments carried out using a laboratory model of Parkinson's disease (PD) (cultures of human dopaminergic neuronal cells) (Whelan H., et. al., SPIE, Newsroom, pages 1-3 (2008)). It has also been shown that light has both inductive and inhibitory effect on cell growth and division in a red tide flagellate, Chattonella antique (Nemote Y., Plant and Cell Physiol., 26(4):669-674 (1985)). When the excitable cells (e.g., neurons, cardiomyocites) are irradiated with monochromatic visible light, the photoacceptors are also believed to be components of respiratory chain. It is clear from experimental data (Karu, T. I., (2002). Low-power laser therapy. In: CRC Biomedical Photonics Handbook, T.

These findings were found to be connected with pain therapy (Karu T I, et al., (2002)). When photoacceptors absorb photons, electronic excitation followed by photochemical reactions occurring from lower excitation states (first singlet and triplet) take place. It is also known that electronic excitation of absorbing centers alters their redox properties. Until yet, five primary reactions have been discussed in literature (Karu T I, et al., (2002)). Two of them are connected with alteration of redox properties and two mechanisms involve generation of reactive oxygen species (ROE). Also, induction of local transient (very short time) heating of absorbing chromophores is possible. Details of these mechanisms can be found in (Karu T I, et. al., (2002); Karu T I, et al., (1998).

Gordon and Breach Sci. Publ., London). Photobiological action via activation of respiratory chain is believed to be a general mechanism occurring in cells. Crucial events of this type of cell metabolism activation are occurring due to a shift of cellular redox potential into more oxidized direction as well as due to ATP extra synthesis. Susceptibility to irradiation and capability for activation depend on physiological status of irradiated cells: the cells, which overall redox potential is shifted to more reduced state (example: some pathological conditions) are more sensitive to the irradiation. The specificity of final photobiological response is determined not at the level of primary reactions in the respiratory chain but at the transcription level during cellular signaling cascades. In some cells, only partial activation of cell metabolism happens by this mechanism (example: redox priming of lymphocytes). Far red and NIR radiation have been shown to promote wound healing, e.g., infected, ischemic, and hypoxic wounds (Wong-Reley, W T T, JBC, 280(6):4761-4771 (2005)).

Other clinical applications of photobiomodulation is repair of soft and bone tissues by IR laser irradiation (Martinez M E, et al., Laser in Med. Sci., 2007). Invasive laser assisted liposuction is a recently developed method, wherein a laser fiber is introduced through a tube into the skin and directly to the fat cells causing the cells to rapture and drain away as liquid (Kim K H, Dermatol.

Yet, another area of application of photobiomodulation is a direct control (or modulation) of brain cell activity with light. The technique is based upon NIR spectroscopy and is simpler to use and less expensive than other methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. Photostimulation can be used to activate a light-sensitive protein such as rhodopsin (ChR2), which can then excite the cell expressing the opsin. It has been shown that channelrhodopsin-2, a monolithic protein containing a light sensor and a cation channel, provides electrical stimulation of appropriate speed and magnitude to activate neuronal spike firing. Recently, photoinhibition, the inhibition of neural activity with light, has become feasible with the application of molecules such as the light-activated chloride pump halorhodopsin to neural control. Together, blue-light activated channelrhodopsin-2 and the yellow light-activated chloride pump halorhodopsin enable multiple-color, optical activation and silencing of neural activity.

The experiments have been conducted in vitro and in vivo in mice by in vivo deep-brain photostimulation using optical fibers to deliver light into the lateral hypothalamus (Adamantidis A R, et al., Nature 450:420-425 (2007)). Genetic targeting of ChR2 allows exclusive stimulation of defined cellular subsets and avoids the need for addition of the caged glutamate, facilitating photostimulation in vivo (Wang H., et al., PNAS, 104(19):8143-48 (2007)). ChR2 photostimulation has been used for restoring visual activity in mice with impaired vision, to evoke behavioral responses in worms and flies (Wang H., et al., 2007). The robust associative learning induced by ChR2-assisted photostimulaiton in mice opens the door to study the circuit basis of perception and cognition in vivo (Huber D., et al., 2007).

Another gene, chloride pump (NpHR), which is borrowed from a microbe called an archaebacterium, can make neurons less active in the presence of yellow light. Combined, the two genes ChR2 and NpHR can now make neurons obey pulses of light like drivers obey a traffic signal: Blue means “go” (emit a signal), and yellow means “stop” (don't emit). Light-sensitive proteins can be introduced into cells or live subjects via a number of techniques including electroporation, DNA microinjection, viral delivery, liposomal transfection and calcium-phosphate precipitation. A third photostimulation technique is chemical modification of ion channels and receptors to render them light-responsive.

Directly controlling a brain cell activity with light is a novel means for experimenting with neural circuits and could lead to therapies for some disorders. This accomplishment is a step toward the goal of mapping neural circuit dynamics on a millisecond timescale to see if impairments in these dynamics underlie severe psychiatric symptoms. In living organisms, scientists were able to cause worms, C. elegans, to stop swimming while their genetically altered motor neurons were exposed to pulses of yellow light intensified through a microscope.

The most direct application of an optical neuron control is experimenting with neural circuits to determine why unhealthy ones fail and how healthy ones work. In patients with Parkinson's disease, for example, researchers have shown that electrical “deep brain stimulation” of cells can help patients. By allowing researchers to selectively stimulate or dampen different neurons in the brain, the light stimulation techniques could help in determining which particular neurons are benefiting from deep brain stimulation.

Problems with LLLT, Cold Laser Therapy, and Laser Biostimulation The laser systems currently used for biostimulation do not allow performing photobiomodulation in a region deep within thick tissue without a surgical invasion. Laser therapy is mostly conducted in surface or near surface target cells and tissue because penetration of UV and red-to-N IR radiation used for photobiomodulation and photobiostimulaiton is no more than a few centimeters beneath the surface of the skin. In addition, imaging and stimulation of brain cells is mainly possible in thin brain slices, or a thin monolayer or suspension of cells. For deeper tissue laser therapy in situ, a subject undergoes various invasive surgical procedures, e.g., invasive insertion of a fiber via incisions into a fat layer or veins, implanting a radiation source in deep tissue, or implanting a glass window above the barrel cortex (Huber D., et al., Nature, 451:61-66 (2007)).

Phototherapy There are two main types of reactions in phototherapy: (1) Type I reactions involve electrons and hydrogen atoms, which are transferred between photo-active molecules (also called photosensitizers) and substrates or solvent molecules.

Unlike chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, PDT is useful in treating all cell types, whether small cell or non-small cell carcinoma. PDT involves treatment of diseases such as cancer using light action on a special photoactive class of drugs, by photodynamic action in vivo to destroy or modify tissue [Dougherty T. J. and Levy J. G., “Photodynamic Therapy and Clinical Applications”, in Biomedical Photonics Handbook, Vo-Dinh T., Ed., CRC Press, Boca Raton Fla. (2003)]. PDT, which was originally developed for treatment of various cancers, has now been used to include treatment of pre-cancerous conditions, e.g. actinic keratoses, high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, and non-cancerous conditions, e.g. various eye diseases, e.g. age related macular degeneration (AMD). Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is approved for commercialization worldwide both for various cancers (lung, esophagus) and for AMD. The PDT process requires three elements: (1) a PA drug (i.e., photosensitizer), (2) light that can excite the photosensitizer and (3) endogenous oxygen. The putative cytotoxic agent is singlet oxygen, an electronically excited state of ground state triplet oxygen formed according to the Type II",

The energy difference between ground state and singlet oxygen is 94.2 kJ/mol and corresponds to a transition in the near-infrared at ˜1270 nm. Most PA photosensitizers in clinical use have triplet quantum yields in the range of 40-60% with the singlet oxygen yield being slightly lower.

A purified hematoporphyrin derivative, Photofrin®, has received approval of the US Food and Drug Administration. Porphyrins are generally used for tumors on or just under the skin or on the lining of internal organs or cavities because theses drug molecules absorbs light shorter than 640 nm in wavelength. For tumors occurring deep in tissue, second generation sensitizers, which have absorbance in the NIR region, such as porphyrin-based systems [R. K.

Photodynamic therapy uses light of a specific wavelength to activate the photosensitizing agent. Various light sources have been developed for PDT, which include dye lasers and diode lasers. Light generated by lasers can be coupled to optical fibers that allow the light to be transmitted to the desired site. See Pass 1-11, “Photodynamic therapy in oncology: mechanisms and clinical use,” J Natl Cancer Inst 1993, 85:443-456. According to researchers, the cytotoxic effect of PDT is the result of photooxidation reactions, as disclosed in Foote C S, “Mechanisms of photooxygenation,” Proa Clin Biol Res 1984, 170:3-18. Light causes excitation of the photosensitizer, in the presence of oxygen, to produce various toxic species, such as singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals.

Such capacity is disused because of a number of reasons, including (a) an occasional need for greater capacity causes consumers to buy excess transportation capacity, (b) variations in schedule and destinations traveled create non-matched transportation needs compared with other household members, (c) lack of knowledge of trusted users who could conveniently use this excess capacity, and (d) difficulty in providing an economic benefit to incentivize the driver to share their excess capacity. Meanwhile, the driver of a vehicle often has no choice but to use a personal transport vehicle (despite the high costs involved) because of lack of accessibility, inconvenient scheduling, or multiple interchanges required if they were to rely on public transport systems.

The inefficient use of transport capacity results in approximately 3-4 times as many cars on the road as would be necessary if capacity were only 50% occupied. This has the additional implications created by the excess consumption of fuel in potential environment problems (CO2 pollution and global warming) as well as geopolitical problems (for example, many countries including the United States could be energy self-sufficient if they used their existing transportation capacity only 40% better (versus the 200+% better that could theoretically be achieved).

Inadequate “feeder systems” for the public transit network mean that billions of dollars are spent creating subway and rail systems that are massively underused, in terms of persons transported per hour versus the potential capacity of these rail systems. The flexibility of highway and road networks, along with the critical mass of car penetration and the marketplace dynamic of urban real estate value, however, means that wherever a highway is built, personal transport cars will soon fill it, creating further urban sprawl, with all the societal and ecological disadvantages that implies. Personal transport cars are common, among other reasons, because (a) the lack of availability of mass transit networks to serve the home or destination of the driver, (b) the inconvenience of waiting a long or unknown period of time for public transit, (c) fear of traveling with strangers or fear in waiting for long periods at public transit",

While even these systems can be improved, these examples show that if a Shared Transport system exists with sufficient timeliness and advantages, it will be widely used. These cities provide transit systems because these systems reduce their cost for infrastructure (i.e., building ever-larger and more inefficient highways) and increases productivity for their citizens and the companies in their region. So, cities have long sought to provide mass transit systems which take people from where they live to where they work and/or where they shop. However, since the popularization of highways in the 1950s in the US, cities have become increasingly suburban. Highway systems do not complement mass transit systems and, in fact, work against mass transit systems by enabling urban sprawl to the point where mass transit infrastructure is unsustainable (at the extremities of a city center, due to lack of",

Obstruction can occur at one or more levels including the retropalatal and retrolingual areas. Surgical correction of such obstructions remains a challenge, specifically for the retrolingual area. Removal or ablation of tongue tissue has been utilized with poor results due to complications, such as severe bleeding, abscess formation, and/or the inability to move the tongue anterior enough to relieve the obstruction. It is known that patients with OSA have a higher percentage of adipose deposits in the areas of obstruction, specifically, the soft palate and uvula, base of tongue and lateral pharyngeal walls. The adipose tissue may be up to or greater than 40% of the total volume of tissues in these areas. Removal of the fat deposits in these areas would permit relief from OSA symptoms while preserving surrounding tissue.

The present application relates to the field of semiconductor integrated circuit manufacturing, and in particular, to methods of making top of dummy polysilicon gates in a gate last process. With continuous reduction of process nodes in semiconductor integrated circuit manufacturing, a gate structure is commonly formed by superposing a high-dielectric-constant (HK) layer and a metal gate (MG), referred to as HKMG technology. One existing method for forming the HKMG is a gate last process. In the gate last process, dummy gate structures with dummy polysilicon gates are often adopted as a self-alignment technique to form sidewall structures, source regions and drain regions. Later the dummy polysilicon gates are removed, and then metal gates are formed in regions where the dummy polysilicon gates are removed. A hard mask layer is usually applied to define the dummy polysilicon gates, so it becomes necessary to remove the hard mask layer before the dummy polysilicon gates are removed. However,",

A hard mask layer is usually applied to define the dummy polysilicon gates, so it becomes necessary to remove the hard mask layer before the dummy polysilicon gates are removed. However, the removal process of the dummy polysilicon gates is usually performed after a contact-etch-stop-layer (CESL) and an interlayer film, usually the zeroth interlayer film, are formed. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the contact-etch-stop-layer on top of the dummy polysilicon gates when performing the chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process on the interlayer film, and the dummy polysilicon gates can be completely removed only after the contact-etch-stop-layer on top of the dummy polysilicon gates is removed. However, in the existing gate last process such as in the 28 nm note with HKMG process, usually a large horn is formed after etching the hard mask layer, making it impossible to completely remove the contact-etch-stop-layer on top of the dummy polysilicon gates in the chemical-mechanical polishing process of the interlayer film, resulting in leaving polysilicon residue at the gate, severely affecting device performance.

Because of the limitation of the etch selection ratio of the photoresist 110 to the hard mask layer in the subsequent second etching-back, the photoresist 110 will be thinned in the subsequent second etching-back. Therefore, one needs to consider the influence of thinning in the second etching-back on the thickness d101 of the photoresist 110 after the first etching-back, that will make the thickness d101 relatively large. When the thickness d101 is relatively large, a photoresist residue 205 will be formed on the side surfaces of the sidewalls 106.

Adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) or adjacent channel leakage power measurement or ratio (ACLR) is ratio between the total power of adjacent channel (assigned to another user) to the main channel's power (useful signal). Often ACPR is desired to be as low as possible. A high ACPR may indicate that significant spectral spreading has occurred. In telecommunications, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a type of digital transmission and a method of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies. OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for wideband digital communication, used in applications, such as digital television and audio broadcasting, DSL internet access, wireless networks, power line networks, and 4G/5G mobile communications. In OFDM, multiple closely spaced orthogonal subcarrier signals with overlapping spectra are transmitted to carry data in parallel. Demodulation is based on Fast Fourier Transform algorithms. Each subcarrier (signal) is modulated with a conventional modulation scheme (such as quadrature amplitude modulation or phase shift keying) at a low symbol rate.",

The launchers are not designed as an efficient fluids device, nor are they designed so that a maximum force is applied where it might be most effective to launch a pig. Instead, fluid enters the barrel as a fluid jet perpendicular to the wall of the barrel. The momentum of the jet crosses from one side of the barrel to the other, diminishing most of the momentum and dropping its dynamic pressure to the pressure of the barrel without doing any immediate work. Additionally, the fluid flow is typically at a relatively low velocity due to the large diameter of the pipe branch or stub entering the barrel. For example, the kicker line is typically about one-third the diameter of the mainline (e.g. a 12-inch [30.48 cm] main, 4-inch [10.16 cm] kicker). Prior art launch units do not typically allow for fluid streams in excess of 7.3 feet per second (about 2.23 meters per second) and at most, in very rare occasions, 30 feet per second (9.14 meters per second), where pipeline product flow is in a range to support those velocities.

Certain embodiments of the present invention are directed to circuits. More particularly, some embodiments of the invention provide systems and methods for controlling power factors. Merely by way of example, some embodiments of the invention have been applied to light emitting diodes (LEDs). But it would be recognized that the invention has a much broader range of applicability. With development in the light-emitting diode (LED) lighting market, many countries and/or organizations have imposed certain requirements on power factor (PF) of LED lighting systems. For example, the power factor (PF) is required to be larger than 0.9. FIG. 1 is a simplified diagram showing a conventional LED lighting system without any Triode for Alternating Current (TRIAC) dimmer. As shown in FIG. 1, the LED lighting system 100 includes a rectifier 120 (e.g., BD1), one or more LEDs 130, and a control unit 110 for LED output current. Also, the LED lighting system 100 does not include any TRIAC dimmer. The control unit 110 for LED output current includes an operational amplifier 112 (e.g., U1), a transistor 114 (e.g., M1), and a resistor 116 (e.g.,",

Indeed, PET is used in a large number of technical fields, such as in the manufacture of clothes, carpets, or in the form of a thermoset resin for the manufacture of packaging or automobile plastics, etc., so that PET accumulation in landfills becomes an increasing ecological problem. The enzymatic degradation of polyesters, and particularly of PET, is considered as an interesting solution to decrease plastic waste accumulation. Indeed, enzymes may accelerate hydrolysis of polyester containing material, and more particularly of plastic products, even up to the monomer level. Furthermore, the hydrolysate (i.e., monomers and oligomers) can be recycled as material for synthesizing new polymers. In this context, several esterases have been identified as candidate degrading enzymes for polyesters, and some variants of such esterases have been developed.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, systemic autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. It is characterized by symmetric synovitis leading to cartilage damage and joint destruction and can be complicated by numerous extra-articular manifestations. Given the presence of autoantibodies, such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), RA is considered an autoimmune disease. RA is generally a progressive disease with functional status decline, significant morbidity and premature mortality seen in established RA. The disease can occur at any age, with a peak incidence between the fourth and sixth decades. The goal of long-term RA treatment is disease remission. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), a heterogenous collection of agents grouped by use and convention, are the first line of treatment for RA patients. DMARDs are used to reduce joint swelling and pain, decrease acute-phase markers, limit the progression of joint damage and to improve joint function. DMARDs, most often methotrexate (MTX),",

MTX therapy is initiated if pain and synovitis persist (especially if function is compromised), and additional DMARDs (with or without steroids) may be added to achieve disease control. Unfortunately, only about ⅔ of patients respond to DMARDS, and DMARDs only partially control established RA disease. Radiological progression continues even in the 5-20% of DMARD-treated RA patients that achieve remission or clinical improvement that approaches remission. DMARDS also have many adverse effects (e.g., liver damage, bone marrow suppression and severe lung infection) that limit their prolonged use. Due to the inadequate responses and dangers associated with prolonged DMARD treatment, biologics have been introduced as second line RA treatments.

Unfortunately, 30-40% of patients with established RA fail to respond to TNF-α antagonists and the majority of those that respond initially do not achieve complete remission or lose response over time. Concerns have also been raised about the short and long-term tolerability and safety of chronic biologic treatment, most notably the reactivation of serious infections (e.g., tuberculosis infections), liver toxicity, increased cardiovascular disease, induction (or exacerbation of) demyelinating conditions, and increased incidence of malignancy due to TNF-alpha antagonisim. M. Khraishi (2009) J. Rheumatol Suppl. 82:25-32; Salliot et al. (2009) Ann. Rheum. Dis. 68:25-32. However, a TNF inhibitor is usually continued unless it becomes ineffective or an adverse event arises, at which point a clinician may switch to either a different TNF inhibitor or a biological with a different mechanism of action (e.g., Kineret® [IL-1R antagonist], MabThera® [CD20 antagonist], Orencia® [CTLA4 fusion protein] or Actemra® [IL-6 receptor",

Scott et al. (2010) The Lancet 376:1095-1108. Given the aforementioned problems with current RA therapy, there is a need to develop new treatments for RA patients. Secukinumab, a new biological in clinical development for RA, is a high-affinity fully human monoclonal anti-human antibody that inhibits Interleukin-17A activity. In an RA proof-of-concept (PoC) study, patients with active RA who were on a stable dose of MTX were dosed in rising single and then 2 doses (21 days apart) with secukinumab at 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg intravenously. Hueber et al. (2010) Sci. Transl. Med. 2(52):52-72. Treatment with secukinumab resulted in rapid improvement of the clinical manifestations of RA in many patients compared to placebo. These data provide evidence that neutralization of IL-17A is likely to be efficacious in RA patients with active RA. However, since patient response to biological treatment is variable and it is desirable to avoid providing drug to patients who will be resistant thereto, we have sought methods of treating RA that first identity those patients most likely to",

Expression of a protein from one system (e.g., organism) in a different system is crucial in applications ranging from drug production to genetically modified food. We have developed a novel method to design genes that are optimized for protein expression in a given system. A gene's DNA sequence encodes a protein, and these proteins are produced, or expressed, to carry out the functions of the cell. Bioengineering can take advantage of the cell as a protein production factory in order to produce heterologous proteins not originally encoded by that cell's genome. As examples, the high demand for insulin for diabetic patients is met by transferring the human insulin gene to bacteria that can then produce insulin in bulk, and genetically modified Bt corn expresses a protein from a bacterium that confers insect resistance. However, a gene from one organism is not always expressed properly in another organism. Each amino acid in a protein can be encoded by any of up to six different codons, or three nucleotide DNA sequences, and different organisms favor different codons to encode the same protein. Use of non-preferred codons can slow down",

Embodiments of the invention generally relate to a method and a device for automatic determination of the change of a hollow organ on the basis of medical images. Dilations of vessels in the human body are a severe risk for a patient, since these dilations, in particular in the aorta, may progress towards an aneurysm which may burst or cause other adverse effects such as heart attacks, kidney damage or stroke. Thus, early detection of such dilations is critical for many diseases, e.g. for the aorta, i.e. aortic dissection, aortic rupture, and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Left untreated, such diseases often have severe and potentially fatal consequences. Therefore, it is important to monitor the progression of a dilation of a particular organ. Additionally, in a post-operative scenario, e.g. after an endovascular aneurysm repair, sac shrinkage is considered to be evidence of clinical success. The problem also can be generalized to any hollow organ such as e.g. other vessels like the airways, or the trachea. Conventionally, changes of hollow organs are diagnosed",

The loss of a loved one can be devastating, and even when the cancer patient survives, the uncertainty is emotionally trying. Cancer exacts an economic toll as well: the estimated direct medical costs for cancer treatment in the United States in 2014 were $87.8 billion, and some sources project that this number could exceed $200 billion in the near future. In addition to cancer, other burdensome diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and autoimmune diseases, continue to affect the lives of millions of people, either directly or indirectly, every year.

Specifically, the cooling air is used as sealing air which is discharged to the gas flow passage and mixed into the hot gas while preventing the inflow of the hot gas. Accordingly, when the cooling air introduced into the disk cavity is reduced as much as possible, the amount of the cooling air mixed as a result of sealing into the hot gas for driving the turbine is reduced. Thus, a reduction in temperature of the hot gas due to the cooling air can be suppressed, and the performance of the gas turbine is expected to be improved.

Semantic pointers can be thought of as elements of a neural vector space and can implement a form of abstraction level filtering or compression, in which high-dimensional structures can be abstracted one or more times thereby reducing the number of dimensions needed to represent a particular structure.

                    "text": "To achieve high energy efficiency many modern radio frequency (RF) transmitters employ what is known as a “polar modulator.” As illustrated in FIG. 1, the principal components of a polar modulator 100 include: a switch-mode power amplifier (SMPA) 102, a phase modulator 104, and a dynamic power supply (DPS) 106. Operating in the polar domain, the DPS 106 modulates a (DC) power supply voltage VDD(DC) by an input amplitude modulating signal AM(t), to produces a time varying DPS voltage VDD(t) that follows AM(t). Meanwhile, the phase modulator 104 modulates an RF carrier by an input phase modulating signal PM(t), to produce a phase-modulated RF carrier. The SMPA 102 serves to translate the phase-modulated RF carrier to higher RF power, so that it can then be radiated over the air to a remote receiver. The RF output power POUT produced by an SMPA is proportional to the square of the magnitude of its DPS voltage, i.e., POUT ∝VDD2(t). This dependency is exploited by the polar modulator 100 to superimpose the amplitude modulation contained in the original input amplitude modulating signal AM(t) onto SMPA's 102's RF output RFOUT. In other words, as the SMPA 102 translates the phase-modulated RF carrier to higher RF power, it also modulates the RF output RFOUT by the AM carried by the DPS",

In other words, as the SMPA 102 translates the phase-modulated RF carrier to higher RF power, it also modulates the RF output RFOUT by the AM carried by the DPS voltage VDD(t) to produce a final phase-modulated RF output RFOUT having a ‘signal envelope’ that follows the original input amplitude modulating signal AM(t). Although RF transmitters constructed from polar modulators can be made to operate with high energy efficiencies, one problem that arises from operating in the polar domain is that the bandwidth of the amplitude modulating signal AM(t) can be high, depending on the modulation scheme being used. For example, the modulation schemes used in Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) systems produce amplitude modulating signals AM(t) that tend to inflect abruptly when traversing to and from zero magnitude. As illustrated in FIG. 2, these sharply inflecting low-magnitude events 202 have substantial high frequency content, so when represented in the frequency domain are seen to have a very wide bandwidth. In order to accurately reproduce the low-magnitude events in the signal envelope of the RF output RFOUT, the DPS 106 must therefore have a wide operating bandwidth capability, preferably at least 5×",

It would be further desirable to have a DPS that has that same capability and that also operates with high energy efficiency. A wideband envelope modulator for a polar modulator is disclosed. The wideband envelope modulator comprises a direct current (DC)-to-DC switching converter connected in series with a linear amplitude modulator (LAM). The DC-DC switching converter includes a pulse-width modulator that generates a PWM signal with modulated pulse widths representing a time varying magnitude of an input envelope signal or a pulse-density modulator that generates a PDM signal with a modulated pulse density representing the time varying magnitude of the input envelope signal, a field-effect transistor (FET) driver stage that generates a PWM or PDM drive signal, a high-power output switching stage that is driven by the PWM or PDM drive signal, and an output",

                    "text": "Niemann-Pick disease Type C (NPC) is a lysosomal lipid storage disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. Symptoms typically manifest beginning in the perinatal period and progress throughout life. The disorder often includes neurological symptoms, such as cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, seizures, vertical gaze palsy, motor impairment, dysphagia, psychotic episodes, and progressive dementia, as well as systemic symptoms in other organs, such as the liver, spleen, or lung. NPC has been described as a cellular cholesterol transport defect, although in the brain accumulation of other lipids, such as GM2 and GM3 gangliosides, also occurs (Vanier, 2010, Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases, vol. 5: 16). Owing to different clinical presentations and course of disease, NPC1 disease is typically categorized as early-infantile onset (<2 yrs), late-infantile onset (2 to <6 years), juvenile onset (6 to <15 years), and adolescent/adult onset (>15 years). Efforts to treat NPC in humans have focused on substrate reduction therapy, such as inhibiting glycosphingolipid synthesis, for example with N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (miglustat, Zavesca®), or on ameliorating overall lipid storage, particularly storage of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, through clearance",

K. et al., 1999, Molecular Biology of the Cell, vol. 10, pages 961-974). Hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrins have also been observed to have beneficial effects in animal models of NPC. For example, a composition comprising 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrins was reported to reverse defective lysosomal transport of cholesterol in the liver and brains of Npc1 knockout mice, and led to a prolongation of life in these mutants compared with no treatment (Liu, B. et al., 2009, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, vol. 106 (7), pages 2377-2382; Davidson et al., 2009, PLoS One 4:e6951).

Various hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin compositions have been administered to human NPC patients in the United States, Brazil, and Japan under compassionate use exemptions, with anecdotal reports of some improvement in various signs and symptoms. However, blinded clinical trials of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin compositions to determine safety and efficacy have not been completed (Ottinger, E.

Given likely observer bias in the anecdotal reports, there is a need for controlled clinical studies to confirm that hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin provides clinical benefit. Effective treatment of NPC will require chronic intrathecal or intracerebroventricular administration beginning in infancy, and parenteral grade compositions of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrins used previously in human patients contain impurities that make them unsuitable for chronic administration directly to the cerebrospinal fluid of infants and children: propylene glycol, which is thought to be ototoxic; beta-cyclodextrin molecules having no hydroxypropyl substitutions, which are known to form precipitates and to have an acute toxicity (Muller and Brauns, 1985, International",

There is, therefore, a need for pharmaceutical compositions of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrins of higher purity. In addition, all existing parenteral grade compositions of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrins contain complex mixtures of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin species having different degrees of hydroxypropyl substitution. The ratios of these species within the mixture differ widely among the various suppliers, and vary even among batches from a single supplier. It is not known how these different species contribute to the pharmacological effects of the complex mixture. There is, therefore, a need for pharmaceutical compositions of hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrins having more precisely defined and precisely controlled mixtures, or fingerprints, of such species.

In this non-randomized, open-label, single-center study conducted by the NIH, Kleptose® HPB is being administered via lumbar injection to drug-naive cohorts of patients at escalating doses. In certain of our analyses, we also included data from three patients being treated with intrathecal Kleptose® HPB at another institution under individual INDs. Our analyses confirmed that intrathecal administration of Kleptose® HPB provides therapeutic benefit in NPC type 1 disease.

More detailed analyses, however, showed that while intrathecal administration of HPBCD improves certain signs and symptoms of NPC type 1 disease, it merely slows progression of others, and paradoxically appears to accelerate progression in other symptoms. In particular, hearing loss appears to have been accelerated in patients receiving intrathecal Kleptose® HPB.
